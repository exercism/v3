# The Exercism V3 Markathon

July 11th is our first Exercism Hackday.
We're focussed on writing Concept Exercises for v3 and as that mainly involves writing Markdown, we've called it the **Markathon**.

The day will officially run from 11am UTC to 11pm UTC, but people are welcome to continue outside of those times.

## Hanging out

The day is happening remotely and we'll be hanging out in two places:

- The [#v3-markathon channel](https://exercism-team.slack.com/archives/C016Q9KEQ91) on Slack.
- An ongoing [video call](https://www.gotomeet.me/exercism)

Tracks can also use their #maintaining-xxx tracks for track-specific discussions.

## Aims of the day

There are three aims to the day:

1. Ensuring lots of people understand what we're trying to achieve with v3 and how everything works.
2. Get each track in a shape where it can welcome contributors. This primiarly involves creating GitHub issues with the `type/new-exercise` label.
3. Have as many people as possible create a Concept Exercise, so lots of people are familiar with the process.

## What you need to know

It's worth investing in a few things to make the most of the day (these things are good use of the day itself!):

- Looking around the docs in https://github.com/exercism/v3/ (start at the README)
- Scanning some of the issues in https://github.com/exercism/v3/issues to familiarise yourself with them
- Looking through https://v3.exercism.io/ and understanding how that works, specifically the "Contribute" and "Create New Exercise" pages.
- Watching these videos:
  - [4 ways that Exercism sucks (and how we're fixing them!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Cj1Dr9m3GM)
  - [The Anatomy of a Concept Exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkbBqd7hPrA)
  - [Forking the "Basics" Concept Exercise from C# to Ruby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esQhPx2U1uk)

Those things should give you a feel for what we're trying to achieve with v3 and how it all works.
But please **ask questions** :)
