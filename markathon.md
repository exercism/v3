# The Exercism V3 Markathon

August 22nd is our second Exercism Hackday.
We're focussed on writing Concept Exercises for v3 and as that mainly involves writing Markdown, we've called it the **Markathon**.

The day will officially run from 11pm UTC on the 21st to 23:59 UTC on the 22nd.

## Hanging out

The day is happening remotely and we'll be hanging out in two places:

- The [#v3-markathon channel](https://exercism-team.slack.com/archives/C016Q9KEQ91) on Slack.
- An ongoing [video call](https://www.gotomeet.me/exercism)

Tracks can also use their #maintaining-xxx tracks for track-specific discussions.

If you're not on Slack but want to be, please email jeremy@exercism.io.

## Jump In

The best way to get started is using our [v3 dashboard](https://v3.exercism.io). Find your language, choose a task on the Contributing task, and get going with it. As you have questions, as them in one of the channels above.

## Aims of the day

There are three aims for this Markathon:

1. Make more progress with content and tooling for v3
2. Get local setups succesfully working on our local machines
3. Get to know each other more as a community

For (2), check out the [instructions in the development-environment repo](https://github.com/exercism/development-environment/blob/master/README.md).

## What you need to know

It's worth investing in a few things to make the most of the day (these things are good use of the day itself!):

- Looking around the docs in https://github.com/exercism/v3/ (start at the README)
- Scanning some of the issues in https://github.com/exercism/v3/issues to familiarise yourself with them
- Looking through https://v3.exercism.io/ and understanding how that works, specifically the "Contribute" and "Create New Exercise" pages.
- Watching these videos:
  - [4 ways that Exercism sucks (and how we're fixing them!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Cj1Dr9m3GM)
  - [The Anatomy of a Concept Exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkbBqd7hPrA)
  - [Forking the "Basics" Concept Exercise from C# to Ruby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esQhPx2U1uk)

Those things should give you a feel for what we're trying to achieve with v3 and how it all works.
But please **ask questions** :)
