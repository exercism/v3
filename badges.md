# V3 Badges

Exercism will have badges from v3. This file lists what's going to be there!

Feel free to PR new Badge ideas to the "To be implemented" bit of this file.
We're keeping the "Rejected" things to avoid multiple PRs and the "Under Consideration" for things where we've discussed it as far as we can and it's down to the Product Team to decide.

Also feel free to suggest changes to the badge names if there is something obviously better (in your opinion!) or in some way offensive.

## Implemented

These are in the codebase.

- **Rookie:** Submit first iteration

## To be implemented

These will be in the codebase. They're unordered.

- **New Year's Resolution:** Submit a solution on January 1st.
- **Die unendliche Geschichte:** Submitted at least 10 iterations to the same exercise, no duplicates. (https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/files/styles/1140x640_hero/public/neverending-story.jpg)
- **All your base are belong to us:** Solved the "All Your Base" exercise.
- **Whatever:** Solve Bob
- **Lackadaisical:** Solve bob in five languages
- **Team builder:** Create a team with 3 members
- **Teammate:** Give team feedback to 5 solutions.

## To be implemented - but involve more code/effort

- **Back In Town:** Login after T time without activity away _(Requires last (not current) seen logging which might already be in Devise)_
- **Early Bird:** Submit a solution before breakfast (~6am, local time). _(Required local timezone storage)_
- **Docker:** Have a Docs PR merged _(How do we automate this? Webhooks listening to certain dirs?)_
- **Badger:** Suggest a badge that is added to the website _(How do we automate this? Probably manual?)_

## May be implemented by the community

These badges will be implementable by PRs from the community nearer the time of v3 launch. We will announce when the repo is open for those PRs.

- **Wednesday Warrior:** Only submit solutions on Wednesdays for 4 consecutive weeks

## Under Consideration

- **Streaked:** Solve at least one exercise a day X days in a row
- **Purgatory:** Write a solution which triggers an execution timeout.
- **Knuth Reward Cheque:** Report an error in an exercise.

## Rejected

- Anything to do with streaks longer than 5 days. We don't want to encourage people not to have days (or weeks) off.
