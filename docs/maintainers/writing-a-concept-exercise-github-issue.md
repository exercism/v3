# Writing a Concept Exercise GitHub issue

The GitHub issues we create for Concept Exercises need to contain quite a lot of information for an implementer to be able to work from. We recommend by [viewing a sample issue](./sample-concept-exercise-issue.md).

We have provided an [Issue Template](https://github.com/iHiD/v3/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%2Fnew-exercise%2C+status%2Fhelp-wanted&template=implement-concept-exercise.md&title=%5B%3CLANG%3E%5D+Implement+new+concept+exercise%3A+%3CSLUG%3E) to make this as straight-forward as possible for you.

We recommend that you write a document explaining to a contributor the details of how concept exercises work for your tracks. You should probably use the [C# instructions](../../languages/csharp/docs/how-to-implement-a-concept-exercise.md) as your basis, and store your file in the equivalent directory.
