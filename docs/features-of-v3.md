# V3 Features

## Restructured tracks

_Talk about changes to Concept/Practice exercises, pathways, and unlocking_
We are restructuring tracks to build new pathways containing "Concept Exercises".

## Concept Exercises

_Talk about what makes a good concept exercise and why_

These exercises teach the key concepts that someone needs to know when learning a langauge, unlocking other Concept and Pracice Exercises as students proress. Concept Exerisies will have automated feedback and approval, with no delays for mentors.

## Approaches

_Talk about what approaches look like and how this will work_

We will be automatically grouping similar solutions to Practice Exercises into Approaches. These will be supported with community-sourced articles expounding each approach, discussing its pros, cons, and potential usages.

## Representers

_Talk about what representers are, how they work, and how they will help_

## In-browser coding

_Talk about what test runners_

We will be adding the ability to solve exericses within the browser. The CLI will remain as a first-class citizen, but v3 will allow people to work their way through a track without having to install anything.

## Improved profiles

Profiles will be getting an upgrade - with contributions throughout the site reflected in them. Mentoring, writing exercises, contributing to tracks, and maintaining parts of Exercism will all feature on profiles. Over time, contributing more will also have tangible improvements to your experience, with bumps up mentor queues and access to early testing features.
