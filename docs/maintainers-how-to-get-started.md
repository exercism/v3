# Maintainers - How to get started

In the early "work-in-progress" phase, this repository holds new exercises that are being created across tracks, in order to elicit a wider set of voices for discussion on these new types of exercises. Once a track is no longer a "work-in-progress," its exercises will be moved to the track's repository.

Maintainers can consider this the new "home of maintainers", replacing `problem-specifications` in that role.

Here are some steps to get you started:

## 1. Fill our your track's README.

Your track's README is the key starting point for people. It should be welcoming and encouraging, and make it clear how they can start contributing.

We recommend using [C#'s README](../languages/csharp/README.md) as a starting point.

## 2. Fill out concepts for your language

To know which Concept Exercises should exist, a list of the language's concepts should first be compiled. There are various resources to use when compiling this list: books, (official) documentation, your own experiences and the concepts listed in this repository.

As many languages have the same concepts (but possibly implemented differently), it can greatly help to look at what other languages have already done in this regard. See the [C# reference.md](./languages/csharp/reference.md) for an example.

It can also be helpful to group related concepts. For example, the Classes, Polymorphism and Inheritance concepts are all object-oriented concepts, which can then be grouped as "Object-oriented concepts".

Filling out the concepts will be iterative, it is hard to get this right immediately. While creating concepts exercises, you'll probably find missing concepts or perhaps want to split out concepts.

## 3. Write your first concept exercise

Once a list of concepts has been compiled, these then need to be translated into [Concept Exercises](./concept-exercises.md). Writing your first concept exercise begins with choosing a concept to write an exercise for. Good first concept candidates are concepts that involve working with basic types, like strings and numbers.

Having chosen a concept, look for the concept's description in this repository. This file should have references to all tracks that have implemented the exercise. You can use these existing implementations as a starting point for your first concept exercise, which you can then tailor to your specific language.
