# Maintainers - How to get started

In the early "work-in-progress" phase, this repository holds new exercises that are being created across tracks, in order to elicit a wider set of voices for discussion on these new types of exercises. Once a track is no longer a "work-in-progress," its exercises will be moved to the track's repository.

Maintainers can consider this the new "home of maintainers", replacing `problem-specifications` in that role.

Here are some steps to get you started:

## 1. Fill our your track's README.

Your track's README is the key starting point for people. It acts both as an introduction to the track, and the start of your tracks project management.

Start with our [guide to writing your track's readme](maintainers-track-readme.md).

## 2. Fill out concepts for your language

One of the key responsibilites for v3 Maintainers is deciding what Concept Exercises are needed.

To help, we've written a [guide to choosing and defining concepts](maintainers-concepts.md).

## 3. Write your first concept exercise

Once a list of concepts has been compiled, these then need to be translated into [Concept Exercises](./concept-exercises.md).

Most of the work here will be done by the community under your supervision. But writing a sample Concept Exercise is a crucial step in both you understanding the process, and having a template in your language that others can base their exercises on.

Writing your first concept exercise begins with choosing a concept to write an exercise for. Good first concept candidates are concepts that involve working with basic types, like strings and numbers.

Having chosen a concept, look for the concept's description in this repository. This file should have references to all tracks that have implemented the exercise. You can use these existing implementations as a starting point for your first concept exercise, which you can then tailor to your specific language.
