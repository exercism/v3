## Enumeration

People should understand the concept of looping/enumerating through things.
They might not know about specific loops (`for`/`while`) or about enumerating an array using a higher-order function (like `each`), but the general concept of stepping through an array should be familiar.

Tracks should teach the normal idiomatic ways to loop/enumerate in their language, but do not need to be exhaustive about all the possibilities (e.g. don't bother teaching `for` in Ruby).
