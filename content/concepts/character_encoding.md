# Character Encoding

## Terminology

- A _character_ is a minimal unit of text that has semantic value.
- A _character set_ is a collection of characters that might be used by multiple languages. Example: The Latin character set is used by English and most European languages, though the Greek character set is used only by the Greek language.
- A _coded character_ set is a character set in which each character corresponds to a unique number.
- A _code point_ of a coded character set is any allowed value in the character set.
- A _code unit_ is a bit sequence used to encode each character of a repertoire within a given encoding form.
