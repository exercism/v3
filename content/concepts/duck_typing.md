# Duck typing

Duck typing is an application of the duck test — "If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck" — to determine if an [object][concept-object] can be used for a particular purpose. With normal typing, suitability is determined by an object's type. In duck typing, an object's suitability is determined by the presence of certain [methods][concept-functions] and properties, rather than the type of the object itself.

[concept-functions]: ./functions.md
[concept-object]: ./objects.md
