# ASCII

> ASCII, abbreviated from **American Standard Code for Information Interchange**, is a [character encoding][concept-encoding] standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.
