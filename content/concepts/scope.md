## Scope / Visibility

Most languages have some concept of encapsulation through scope and visibility.
Tracks should explain the language-concepts and keywords that their track uses (e.g. `public`, `private`, `export`) and what the normal way of using those scopes are in their language. An exercise may be appropriate, but providing examples in stubs early on may avoid overwhelming the student.
