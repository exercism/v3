# Destructuring Assignment

The destructuring assignment syntax is an expression that makes it possible to unpack values from [arrays][type-array], iterables, [lists][type-list], or properties from objects, into distinct variables, depending on the language.

[type-array]: ../types/array.md
[type-list]: ../types/list.md
