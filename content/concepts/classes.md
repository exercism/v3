# Classes

A `class` is the primary construct for keeping [state][concept-state], and usually represents one specific concept in your domain.
An `object` is a particular instance of a class.

For example, we may create a class called "Person" which acts a template of a human, with fields for `name` and `age`. We may then have multiple [objects][concept-objects] that are particular instances of that person, e.g. "Katrina" or "Jeremy".

[concept-objects]: ./objects.md
[concept-state]: ./state.md
