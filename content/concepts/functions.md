## Functions

By "functions" we mean functions, methods and procedures.

We do not aim to teach:

- "functions" as the concept of self-contained pieces of functionality
- the concepts of passing data into functions
- the concept of returning data from functions

Language-specific rules such as closures, anonymous functions, or partial application, should be covered in tracks.
