# Evaluation

Evaluation often refers to the _evaluation_ of an [expression][concept-expressions].

In some programming languages `eval` is a [function][concept-functions] which evaluates a [`string`][type-string] as though it were an [expression][concept-expressions] and [returns a result][concept-return-values]; in others, it executes multiple lines of code as though they had been included instead of the line including the `eval`.

[concept-expressions]: ./expressions.md
[concept-functions]: ./functions.md
[concept-return-values]: ./return_values.md
[type-string]: ../types/string.md
