# Functional programming

TODO: add description of functional programming

These are functional programming concepts that are found in the majority of functional languages.
For each, this document will list a canonical reference that explains the concept in general terms.
The tracks should link to these references the first time the topic is referenced.
For example, the first time a person is expected to deal with immutability, the README should say "if you are unfamiliar with the concept of immutability, please read this explanation...."

Track-specific sub-concepts of these could be covered by specific track exercises.
Each section below aims to draw the distinction between general and language-specific concepts.

This document aims to cover all the core topics that a programmer with any functional programming background would know.
