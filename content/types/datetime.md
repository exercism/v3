# DateTime

A compound type combining [Date][type-date] and [Time][type-time] into one. Some DateTime types have _timezone information_.

The difference between two times may be representable by a [Duration][type-duration].

[type-date]: ./date.md
[type-duration]: ./duration.md
[type-time]: ./time.md
