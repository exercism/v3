# List

A [collection][type-collection] data structure in which a sequence of items that are associated together in order, but are not physically associated together in a contiguous block of memory as they would be in an [array][type-array]. In a singly-linked list, for example, each item is a node that contains the value for that item and a reference to the next node in the array.

In many languages lists are _homogenous_ like arrays, and can contain only one type of item internally. In some languages, however, lists are _heterogenous_ and can contain multiple types of item.
