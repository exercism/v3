# Hash map

A [collection][type-collection] data structure that uses a [hash function][concept-hashing] to associate a key with a particular value. Key lookup is usually more efficient than searching through an [array][type-array], but the hash map requires more memory.

[type-array]: ./array.md
[type-collection]: ./collection.md
