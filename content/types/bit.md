# Bit

A bit is the atomic unit of computation in computers. It can have two values: `0` or `1`. The most common way of working with bits is in the form of a [byte][type-byte], which is exactly eight bits.

## Sign bit

The sign bit is a bit in a [signed][type-signed] [number][type-number] representation that indicates the [sign][concept-signedness] of a number. Although only signed numeric data types have a sign bit, it is invariably located in the most significant bit position, so the term may be used interchangeably with "most significant bit" in some contexts.
