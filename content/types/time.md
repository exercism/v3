# Time

A type that represents a certain time. Some time types have _timezone information_. Some time types also include a specific [date][type-date], whilst others only encode a certain _time of the day_.

The difference between two times may be representable by a [Duration][type-duration] or TimeInterval.

See also [DateTime][type-datetime] and [Date][type-date].

[type-date]: ./date.md
[type-datetime]: ./datetime.md
[type-duration]: ./duration.md
