# Integer

An integer is a whole number (no fractions). There are two basic types of integers

- Unsigned integers: only positive integers (0, 1, 2, ...).
- Signed integers: positive _and_ negative integers (..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2).

## Sizes

Various programming languages _limit_ the range of values a single integer can hold. They may also have various variants that have different range restrictions. Theses names include, but are not limited to:

- [Bit][type-bit]
- [Byte][type-byte]
- [Char][type-char]
- [Short][type-short]
- [Long][type-long]
- [Word][type-word]

[type-bit]: ./bit.md
[type-byte]: ./byte.md
[type-char]: ./char.md
[type-long]: ./long.md
[type-short]: ./short.md
[type-word]: ./word.md
