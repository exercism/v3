# Short

Short is short for `short int`.

> A _short integer_ can represent a whole number that may take less storage, while having a smaller range, compared with a standard [integer][type-integer] on the same machine. In C, it is denoted by `short`. It is required to be at least 16 [bits][type-bit], and is often smaller than a standard integer, but this is **not** required.

See [`integer`][type-integer].
