# Python

Python is an interpreted, dynamically (but strongly) typed, and garbage-collected general programming language that has become extremely popular due to its readability, low barrier for entry, and exceptionally deep ecosystem of libraries and tools. Python is object-based, but is inherently multi-paradigm and has drawn together influences from a wide range of programming languages, including ABC, Haskell, Lisp, and Modula-3.
