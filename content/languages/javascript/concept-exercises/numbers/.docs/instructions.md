# Instructions

In this exercise you'll be writing code to help a freelancer communicate with a
project manager by providing a few utilities to quickly calculate day- and
month rates, optionally with a given discount.

We first establish a few rules between the freelancer and the project manager:

- The daily rate is 8 times the hourly rate;
- A month has 22 billable days.

The freelancer is offering to apply a discount if the project manager chooses
to let the freelancer bill per month, which can come in handy if there is a
certain budget the project manager has to work with.

Discounts are modeled as fractional numbers followed by a `%` (percentage)
between `0.0%` (no discount) and `90.0%` (maximum discount).

## Tasks

### 1. Calculate the day rate given an hourly rate

Implement a function to calculate the day rate given an hourly rate:

```javascript
dayRate(89)
// => 712
```

The day rate does not need to be rounded or changed to a "fixed" precision.

### 2. Calculate the month rate, given an hourly rate and a discount

Implement a function to calculate the month rate, and apply a discount:

```javascript
monthRate(89, '42%')
// => 9086
```

The discount is always passed as a `string`. The result _must_ be rounded up to
the nearest whole number.

### 3. Calculate the number of workdays given a budget, rate and discount

Implement a function that takes a budget, a rate per hour and a discount, and
calculates how many days of work that covers, to one decimal place.

```javascript
daysInBudget(20000, 89, '20.02%')
// => "35.1"
```

The discount is always passed as a `string`. The result is the number of days
to one decimal place, as a `string`.
