Continuing the theme of the wizards and  warriors game it is time to add an all purpose die rolling method.  This will be the traditional 18 sided dice with numbers 1 to 18. 

## 1. Implement a `RollDie()` method on the `Player` class.

```csharp
var player = new Player();
player.RollDie();
// => 13
```
