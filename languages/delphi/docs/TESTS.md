## Running The Tests 

Exercises that have been fetched using the [Exercism command line client](https://exercism.io/cli) are delivered with a minimum of three files: a `readme.md` file, a `.dpr` file, and a `.pas` file.  The `.dpr` file is the Delphi project file and the `.pas` file is the test runner.  Load the Delphi project by either double clicking on the `.dpr` file or by opening the project from within Delphi.  You will be responsible for creating a new `.pas` file that will contain your solution code that the tests will be run against.  Refer to the `readme.md` file for instruction on how to compile and execute your code.

All tests have been ignored except the first one for you to work on. To continue, just comment the `[Ignore]` attribute on the test to start working on it.

Make sure [DUnitX](https://github.com/VSoftTechnologies/DUnitX) is installed, if not already installed from the setup above.
