Exercism provides exercises and feedback but can be difficult to jump into for those learning Pascal for the first time. These resources can help you get started:

* [Pascal Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/pascal/index.htm) looks like a good place to get your feet we with Pascal if you have zero experience with this language.  You do not need Delphi to complete the exercises covered in this tutorial.  This may be a good place to practice up before jumping in to the exercises here, which do require Delphi to complete.
* [Pascal-Programming.info](http://www.pascal-programming.info/index.php) also appears to have a good tutorial for newcomers to the language.
* There are many more sources online for learning Pascal, too many to list here.
