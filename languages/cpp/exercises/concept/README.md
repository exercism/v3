# C++ concept exercises

The concept exercises are based on this [list of concepts][reference-shared].

## Implemented exercises

These are the concept exercises that have currently been implemented, as well as the concepts they teach and their prerequisite concepts:

| exercise                              | concepts  | prerequisites |
| ------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------- |
| [`strings`][concept-exercise-strings] | `strings` | -             |

**⚠ Note ⚠**: The idea here is to use a `concept` name for the exercise/folder, but perhaps use some sort of "progression", so they will naturally become a sort of path to traverse.

It's only important that it's reasonably easy to _find_ the exercise. It's okay if the name isn't perfect. We **will** iterate on this.

## TODO

Thanks for wanting to contribute to the C++ track's concept exercises! Contributions are very welcome!
