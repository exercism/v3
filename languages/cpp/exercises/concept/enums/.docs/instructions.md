In this exercise you'll be processing `enums`.

You have three tasks, each of which will take a integral constant and ask you to do something

## 1. Get the name of the month

Implement the `Display` method to return the name of ith month of the year using enums:

```cpp
Display(1)
// => "January"
```

## 2. Get the number of days of a month 

Implement the `NoofDays` method to return the number of days of a month in a year using enums:

```cpp
NoofDays("January")
// => 31
```

## 3. Assigning Season

Implement the `AssignSeasson` method that assigns a month a praticular season(S,R,A,W) and displays it using enums:

```cpp
AssignSeason("January")
// => 'W'
```
