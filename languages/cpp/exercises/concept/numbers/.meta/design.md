## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student how to work with integer and floating point numbers in C++.

## Learning objectives

- Know the different types of integer and floating point numbers.
- Know integer type modifiers.
- Know of basic operators such as multiplication, comparison and equality.
- Know how to conditionally execute code using an `if` statement.

## Out of scope

- Arithmetic
- Parsing a `std::string` to an `int` or `double`.
- Converting an `int` or `double` to a `std::string`.
- User defined literals

## Concepts

- `numbers`: know of the existence of the two most commonly used number types: integer and floating point; know of basic operators such as multiplication, comparison and equality.
- `conditionals`: know how to conditionally execute code using an `if` statement.
