### Special integer types

There are two other important integer types often used in the standard library:

- `std::size_t`: unsigned integer type of the result of the `sizeof` operator as well as the `sizeof... operator` and the `alignof` operator (since C++11).
- `std::ptrdiff_t`: is the signed integer type of the result of subtracting two pointers. The bit width of `std::ptrdiff_t` is not less than 17.

### Integer literals

Integer values can be written using several different notations.

- `10` - decimal number
- `010` - octal number
- `0xa` - hexadecimal number
- `0b001` - binary number

### Digit separators

Long numbers in C++ can be separated for readability using `'` (single quotation mark). For example, `10000` is equivalent `10'000`.

### Numeric limits

Compile-time information about a numeric type is available using meta-functions from `<limits>`.

### Conversions

When converting between numeric types, there are two types of numeric conversions:

1. Implicit conversions: generated by the compiler, no additional syntax is required, data maybe be lost: e.g. `double` -> `int`.
2. Explicit conversions: data could be lost and additional syntax in the form of a _cast_ is required.

### Complex numbers

Complex numbers are represented with [`std::complex`][complex] standard module.
