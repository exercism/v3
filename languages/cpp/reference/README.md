## Concepts

The C++ concept exercises are based on concepts. The list below contains the concepts that have been identified for the C++ language.

### Object-oriented

The core OO features a C++ developer should know about are:

- Initialization
- [Encapsulation](../../../reference/concepts/encapsulation.md)
- [Classes](../../../reference/concepts/classes.md)
- [Objects](../../../reference/concepts/objects.md)
- [State](../../../reference/concepts/state.md)

### Functional

C++ is a very flexible language, so lots of functional concepts apply to it:

- [Immutability](../../../reference/concepts/immutability.md) (`const`ness)

This also indicates that for example `strings-basic` does **not** teach using custom formatting strings and that `numbers-basic` does **not** teach about integer undefined-behavior.
