You're working on implementing an RPG game. The player's character is represented by the following:

```rust
pub struct Player {
    health: u32,
    mana: Option<u32>,
    level: u32,
}
```

Players in this game must reach level 10 before they unlock a mana pool so that they can start casting spells. Before that point, the Player's mana is `None`.

You're working on two pieces of functionality in this game, the revive mechanic and the spell casting mechanic. 

The `revive` method should check to ensure that the Player is indeed dead (their health has reached 0), and if they are, the method should return a new Player instance with 100 health. If the Player's level is 10 or above, they should also be revived with 100 mana. If they Player's level is below 10, their mana should be `None`. The `revive` method should preserve the Player's level. 

```rust
let dead_player = Player { health: 0, mana: None, level: 2 };
dead_player.revive()
// Returns Player { health: 100, mana: None, level: 2 }
```

If the `revive` method is called on a Player whose health is 1 or above, then the method should return `None`.

```rust
let alive_player = Player { health: 1, mana: 15, levelv 11 };
alive_player.revive()
// Returns None
```

The `cast_spell` method takes a mutable reference to the Player as well as a `mana_cost` parameter indicating how much mana the spell costs. It should check to ensure that the Player has access to a mana pool, as well as check to make sure that they have enough mana to satisfy the `mana_cost`. In the case that the Player has enough mana, the `mana_cost` should be deducted from the Player's mana pool. If the Player doesn't have enough mana, the method should print "Not enough mana!".

```rust
let low_mana_wizard = Player { health: 93, mana: Some(3), level: 12 };
low_mana_wizard.cast_spell(10)
// Prints "Not enough mana!"
```

If the Player doesn't have access to their mana pool yet, the method should print "Only wizards can cast spells!".

```rust
let not_a_wizard_yet = Player { health: 78, mana: None, level: 9 };
not_a_wizard_yet.cast_spell(5)
// Prints "Only wizards can cast spells!"
```

Have fun!
