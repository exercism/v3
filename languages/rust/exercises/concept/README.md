# Rust concept exercises

The concept exercises are based on this [list of concepts][reference].

## Implemented exercises

These are the concept exercises that have currently been implemented, as well as the concepts they teach and their prerequisite concepts:

| exercise                              | concepts                           | prerequisites |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------- |
| [`enums`][concept-exercise-enums]     | `basic-enums`<br/>`conditionals`   | `strings`     |
| [`numbers`][concept-exercise-numbers] | `basic-numbers`<br/>`conditionals` | `strings`     |

It's only important that it's reasonably easy to _find_ the exercise. It's okay if the name isn't perfect. We **will** iterate on this.

## TODO

Thanks for wanting to contribute to the Rust track's concept exercises! Contributions are very welcome!

To contribute, please find and work on one of the [new exercise issues][issues-new-exercise] or [exercise improvement issues][issues-improve-exercise].
