# Rust concept exercises

The concept exercises are based on this [list of concepts][reference].

## Implemented exercises

These are the concept exercises that have currently been implemented, as well as the concepts they teach and their prerequisite concepts:

| exercise                                                            | concepts                                                            | prerequisites                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`numbers`][concept-exercise-numbers]                               | `integers`<br/>`floats`<br/>`conditionals` | -                                                                   |
| [`enums`][concept-exercise-enums]                                   | `basic-enums`<br/>`conditionals`                            | `strings`                                                     |

It's only important that it's reasonably easy to _find_ the exercise. It's okay if the name isn't perfect. We **will** iterate on this.

## TODO
