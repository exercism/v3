# Design 

## Goal
The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of working with named-field `structs` in Rust. `structs` are an essential user-defined type.

## Learning objectives
- Know what the `struct` keyword means
- Know how to create `struct`s
- Know how to define methods on `struct`s
- Know the basics of different kinds of `struct`s

## Out of scope
- representation in memory
- advanced treatment of 
    - generic structs
    - unit structs (zero-sized structs)
    - tuple structs

## Concepts
- structs

## Prerequisites
- basics
- string-use
- unsigned-ints
- floats
