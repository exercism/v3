R is an open source, programming *lingua franca* of statistics. 
It was created by **R**oss Ihaka and **R**obert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, who wanted a language that was better suited to statistical computing and easier to use than comparable software designed by computer scientists.

In addition to being a programming language, R is also an environment for interactive data analysis. 
Its powerful metaprogramming capabilities allow for magically succinct and concise functions. 
It can also integrate with high-performance programming languages like Fortran, C, and C++. 
These combined attributes provide an excellent environment for designing [domain-specific languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language).

Ross Ihaka describes R as "a real demonstration of the power of collaboration". 
R has a fantastic community of both users and developers, who contribute to a massive (and rapidly growing) collection of [packages](https://cran.r-project.org/) for importing, manipulating and visualising data, as well as cutting edge methods for statistical modelling and machine learning.
