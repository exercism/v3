[D](https://dlang.org) is a systems programming language with
C-like syntax and static typing. It combines efficiency, control and modeling power with safety
and programmer productivity. The language was developed originally by [Walter Bright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Bright) and [Andrei
Alexandrescu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Alexandrescu) since D version 2.

D is the culmination of decades of experience implementing compilers for many diverse languages and has a large number
of [unique features](http://dlang.org/overview.html):

- high level constructs for great modeling power
- high performance, compiled language
- static typing
- evolution of C++ (without the mistakes)
- direct interface to the operating system API's and hardware
- blazingly fast compile-times
- allow memory-safe programming (SafeD)
- maintainable, easy to understand code.
- short learning curve (C-like syntax, similar to Java and others)
- compatible with C application binary interface
- multi-paradigm (imperative, structured, object oriented, generic, functional programming purity, and even assembly)
- built-in error prevention (contracts, unittests)

The [D Language Foundation](https://dlang.org/foundation.html) is the organization devoted to developing and
advancing the D language.
