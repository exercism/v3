## Learning D

In general, exercism assumes you already know the syntax and mechanisms
of a language in a particular track.  However, knowing the syntax of a
language is merely the first step in gaining expertise in a language.
Exercism allows you to practice solving problems and share discussion
with other programmers who have solved the same problem.  It is from
the shared discussion that we gain expertise and insight into becoming
better programmers.

Here are a couple of resources to get you started:

* [Learning D as a beginner](http://ddili.org/ders/d.en/index.html), Ali Cehreli excellent book
* [Learning D for experienced programmers](http://wiki.dlang.org/Coming_From) coming from other languages
* [D Tutorials](https://wiki.dlang.org/Tutorials)
* [Overview of D's unique features](http://dlang.org/overview.html)
* [Common questions about D](http://dlang.org/faq.html)
* [DConf](http://dconf.org/2016/index.html) presentations and videos on YouTube

To get more help:

* Ask questions in the [#d](irc://irc.freenode.net/d) IRC channel on freenode ([web
  interface](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/d))
* Get help at [D.learn](http://forum.dlang.org/group/learn)
* Open an issue at the [D bugtracker](https://issues.dlang.org/)

## Test-Driven Development

Exercism assumes that you are familiar with the concept of test-driven
development. Each exercise comes with a series of tests that are already
written for you. You progress through the exercise one test at a time,
writing an implementation incrementally to satisfy the tests.
