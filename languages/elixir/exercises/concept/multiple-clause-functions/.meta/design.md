# Concept Exercise: multiple-clause-functions

## Goal

The goal for this exercise is to teach more about functions in elixir and how to use multiple functions clauses, guards

## Learning objectives

A student upon completion will:

- Know what a guard is.
- Know how to use a guard.
- Know that guards return strict boolean values.
- Know that guards meet certain guarantees to not mutate state.
- Know that guards must be declared in a special form, and not all functions that return boolean values are guards.
- Know how to write basic multiple-clause functions.
- Know how to use guards to protect execution of a function.
- Know how to use guards to perform basic control flow.
- Know how to specify a default arguemnt
- Know that by specifying a default argument, it defines multiple arities for the function name
