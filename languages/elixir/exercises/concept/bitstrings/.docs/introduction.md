Working with binary data is an important concept in any language, and Elixir provides an elegant syntax to write, match, and construct binary data.

## Bitstrings

In Elixir, binary data is referred to as the bitstring type. The binary datatype is a specific form of a bitstring, which we will discuss in a later exercise.

Bitstring literals are defined using the bitstring special form `<<>>`. When defining a bitstring literal, you must also specify how many bits the value will take up using the `::` type declaration operator.

```elixir
# This defines a bitstring with three segments of a single bit each
<<0::1, 1::1, 0::1>> == <<0::size(1), 1::size(1), 0::size(1)>>
<<0::1, 1::1, 0::1>> == <<2::size(3)>>
```

If the value of the segment overflows the capacity of the segment's type, it will be truncated from the left.

When writing binary integer literals, we can write them directly in base-2 notation by prefixing the literal with `0b`: E.g. `0b10 == 2`

```elixir
value = 0b11111011011
<<value::11>>
# => <<251, 3::size(3)>>
# Note that by default, bitstrings are displays in chunks of 8 bits (a byte)
```

## Constructing

We can combine bitstrings stored in variables using the special form:

```elixir
value = 0b0110
first = <<value::4>>
second = <<0b1001::4>>
combined = <<first::bitstring, second::bitstring>>
```

## Pattern matching

Pattern matching can also be done to obtain the value from within the special form:

```elixir
<<value::4, rest::bitstring>> = <<0b01101001::8>>
value == 0b0110
```
