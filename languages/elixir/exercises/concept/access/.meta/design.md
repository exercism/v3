# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach how to use the access behavior to retrieve data from nested data structures which implement the behavior. Out of the box, maps and keyword lists implement the access behavior.

## Learning objectives

- Know of the access behavior
- Know that the access behavior can be used on maps and keyword lists
- Know the syntax for the access behavior
- limitations of the access behavior
  - doesn't work for structs
  - doesn't raise errors

## Out of scope

- structs
- static access operator

## Concepts

- `map-access-behavior`

## Prerequisites

- `keyword-lists` TODO
- `regex` TODO
- `maps`
- `strings`
- `recursion`
- `nil-values`

## Narrative for exercise

Follows the **Basketball Website Story** (outlined [here](https://github.com/exercism/v3/blob/master/reference/stories/deep-dig.basketball-team-website.md))

## Resources to refer to

- [access-behavior](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Access.html)

## Representer

- TBD

## Analyzer

- That `structs` aren't used.
- That the `static access operator` isn't used.
