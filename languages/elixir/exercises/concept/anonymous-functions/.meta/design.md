# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach students how to use anonymous functions, return functions from functions, use closures in code.

## Learning objectives

After completing this exercise, the student should:

- Know how to write [anonymous functions][fns].
- Know how to return a function from a function.
- Know how to use closures in elixir.
- Be exposed to the capture notation in the after.md

## Out of scope

- pattern matching
- function overloading

## Prerequisites

This exercise's prerequisites are:

- `basics`: needs to be able to define named functions, return values

## Concepts

The concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `anonymous-functions`: know of the existence of anonymous functions and know how to write them.
- `closures`: know how to use closures in Elixir

## Representer

This exercise does not require any specific representation logic to be added to the [representer][representer].

## Analyzer

This exercise does not require any specific logic to be added to the [analyzer][analyzer].
