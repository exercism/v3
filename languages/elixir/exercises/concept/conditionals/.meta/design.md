# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach students how to use conditional control flow structures

## Learning objectives

After completing this exercise, the student should:

- Know of the existence of the `cond/1` control flow structure and how to use it.
- Know how to perform boolean logic using the `===/2` operator function.
- Know how to return values from a function with conditional logic.
- Know of the existence of the [atom][atom] type

## Out of scope

- Pattern matching.
- Function overloading.
- `case` flow control structures.
- Converstion of string to atoms.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `conditionals`: know of the existence of the `cond` control flow structure; know how to use boolean expressions to control flow;
- `atoms`: know how to use `atom` values.

## Prequisites

This exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `basics`: be able to define a named function, return a value.
- `booleans`: be able to work with boolean values, boolean expressions

## Representer

This exercise does not require any specific representation logic to be added to the [representer][representer].

## Analyzer

This exercise does not require any specific logic to be added to the [analyzer][analyzer].
