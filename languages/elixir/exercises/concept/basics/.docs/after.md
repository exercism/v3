- Elixir is dynamically-typed
  - the type of a variable is only checked at run-time
- Using the match `=/2` operator, we can bind a value of any type to a variable name:
  - It is possible to re-bind variables
  - A variable may have any type of value bound to it.

## Modules

- Modules are the basis of code organization in Elixir.
  - A module is visible to all other modules.
  - A module is defined with `defmodule`.

## Named Functions

- All named functions must be defined in a module.

  - Named functions are defined with `def`.
  - A named function may be made private from external modules by using `defp` instead.
  - The value of the last line of a function is _implicitly returned_ after it is evaluated
  - Short functions may also be written using a one-line syntax.

  ```elixir
  def increment(n) do
    n + 1
  end

  defp private_increment(n) do
    n + 1
  end

  def short_increment(n), do: n + 1
  ```

- Functions are invoked using the full name of the function with the module name.
  - If invoked from within its own module, the module name may be omitted.
- The arity of a function is often used when referring to a named function

  - The arity refers to the number of parameters it accepts.

  ```elixir
  def add(x, y, z), do: x + y + z # add/3, because the arity is 3
  ```

## Integers

- Integer values are whole numbers written with one or more digits.
  - You may use underscores to separate large numbers.
  - Integers support the [basic mathematical operators][operators].

## Comments

- Elixir supports [inline documentation][inline-documentation]

  - Single line comments are preceded by `#`.
  - Comments to document a named function must precede the named function definition

  ```elixir
  @doc """
  Function Documentation
  """
  def function(), do: true
  ```

  - One comment to document a module may immediately follow the module definition

  ```elixir
  defmodule Example do
    @moduledoc """
    Module documentation
    """
  end
  ```
