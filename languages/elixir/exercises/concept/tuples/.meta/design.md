# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of tuples and common conventions in elixir to return multiple values.

This is done through the implementation of a basic kitchen calculator.

## Learning objectives

- Know what a tuple is
- Know how to write a tuple literal
- Know how to return a tuple from a function
- Know that returning a tuple is a common for of multiple return in Elixir
- Know how to extract an element from a tuple using `elem/2`
- Know how to write a floating point literal
- Know how to round a floating point number to decimal place or integer

## Out of scope

- unsure

## Prerequisites

The exercise's prerequisites are:

- `basics`: needs to be able to define named functions, define and return integers, return values from functions
- `atoms`: needs to be able to define and use atoms for return values
- `multiple-clause-functions`: need to know that a named function can be overloaded and elixir will attempt to use them all until one found

## Concepts unlocked

- `tuples` know of the existence of the `tuple` data type, how to define tuple literals, extract values from a tuple using `elem/2`
- `floating-point-numbers` know of the existence of the floating point number type, know that it is double precision float encoding, how to convert it to an integer type

## Representer

This exercise does not require any specific representation logic to be added to the [representer][representer].

## Analyzer

This exercise could benefit from the following rules added to the the [analyzer][analyzer]:

- Verify common conversion functions aren't used from the standard library if they exist.
