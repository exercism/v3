## General

- Review the official documentation:
  - [Elixir Getting Started - Errors][getting-started-errors]
  - [Elixir Getting Started - IO][getting-started-io]

## 1. Open a file

- Use _dynamic dispatch_ to use invoke the open function.
  - Review the introduction code snippet

## 2. Attempt to write to the file

- Make use of the try-rescue construct
- Review the IO module's [`write/2`][io-write] function
- You can use the `rescue` block to pattern match on the error and return the error tuple
- You can use the `else` block to pattern match on the return of a successful write.

## 3. Close the file

- You can use the `after` block to carry out a function whether a `try` block succeeds or is rescued.
