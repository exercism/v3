# `RedefinedIdent` Error

## Example

```purescript
module Example where

a = 3

a = 5

```

## Cause

You have defined a value with the same name multiple times.

## Fix

- Rename one of the variables. In this example:

  ```purescript
  a = 3

  a' = 5
  ```

## Notes

- This error also occurs if you have multiple clauses for a function, where you misspelled the function name once. For Example:
  ```purescript
  bar [] = 10
  barr [2] = 2
  bar x = length x
  ```
