In the introduction, we explained functions and said that every function has one or more arguments. This is not strictly true. Technically all functions have only one argument; this is called [function currying][function-currying]).

PureScript is syntactically similar to Haskell, meaning they look and act very much alike. If you're ever stuck on a problem, it can be helpful to search for solutions in Haskell, and apply them to your code in PureScript.
