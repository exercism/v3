### General

- An [integer value][integers] can be defined as one or more consecutive digits.

### 1. Define the expected oven time in minutes

- You need to define a [function][functions] without any arguments.
- You need to return an [integer][integers].

### 2. Calculate the remaining oven time in minutes

- You need to define a [function][functions] with a single parameter.
- You have to [return an integer][type-annotations] from a function.
- The function's argument is an [integer][integers].
- You can use the [mathematical operator for subtraction][operators] to subtract values.

### 3. Calculate the preparation time in minutes

- You need to define a [function][functions] with a single parameter.
- You have to [return an integer][type-annotations] from a function.
- The function's argument is an [integer][integers].
- You can use the [mathematical operator for multiplicaton][operators] to multiply values.

### 4. Calculate the total working time in minutes

- You need to define a [function][functions] with two parameters.
- You have to [return an integer][type-annotations] from a function.
- The function's parameter is an [integer][integers].
- You can invoke one of the other functions you've defined previously.
- You can use the [mathematical operator for addition][operators] to add values.
