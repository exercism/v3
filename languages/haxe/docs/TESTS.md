## Running Tests
The Haxe track relies on the testing framework [Buddy](https://github.com/ciscoheat/buddy).  You can install it with the following:

```bash
haxelib install buddy
```

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
haxe test.hxml
```

## Solving the exercise

Solving an exercise means making all of its tests pass. To help you get started, each exercise comes with a stub implementation file. You can use this file as a starting point for building your solution. Feel free to remove or change this file if you think it is the right thing to do.  Try focusing on a single test at a time as you work towards the solution.
