[Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org/) is the Apache Foundation's powerful, optionally typed, dynamic language, which also features static-typing and static compilation capabilities.

Groovy is aimed at improving developer productivity thanks to a concise, easy to learn syntax.
It facilitates scripting, Domain-Specific Language authoring, runtime and compile-time meta-programming, and functional programming.

It allows access to the entire ecosystem of Java libraries, and integrates seamlessly with Java applications.

It can be used as a simple scripting language or added to complicated Java frameworks. 
It powers technologies like: 
* Gradle, 
* Spock, 
* Ratpack, 
* Grails, 
* and scripting in Jenkins.

Also, it is fun.
