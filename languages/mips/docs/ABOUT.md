MIPS is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architecture, currently used mostly in video game consoles and routers. It is also a popular architecture in introductory courses and textbooks on computer architecture, due to its simplicity relative to x86 and ARM. Here we use the 32-bit instruction set; a 64-bit instruction set also exists.

This track involves programming in MIPS assembly language, assembled and run on a cross-platform simulator.
