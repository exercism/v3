To run the tests, assemble and run the test runner file for a given exercise either via the MARS simulator GUI, or on the command line. To run on the command line,
specify first the runner file and then your implementation, like so:

    java -jar /path/to/mars.jar nc runner.mips impl.mips

To run in the GUI, `include` your implementation at the bottom of "runner.mips"
by uncommenting the final line.

The test runner will either complete with a “success” message or terminate on a failing test with a message specifying the input for which that test failed.
