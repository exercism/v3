Coq is a formal proof management system. It provides a formal language to write mathematical definitions, executable algorithms and theorems together with an environment for semi-interactive development of machine-checked proofs.

There are some free resources for learning Coq, such as:

* Software Foundations series:
    + [Volume 1: Logical Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/lf-current/index.html)
    + [Volume 2: Programming Language Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/index.html)
    + [Volume 3: Verified Functional Algorithms](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/vfa-current/index.html)
* Certified Programming with Dependent Types:
    + Which is avalaible for free in [Adam Chipala's site](http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/).
