Bash is a very powerful Unix shell and command scripting language. 
The man page for Bash is a well written and informational document. 
Additional guides, information, and examples can be found at 
[Greg's Wiki](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide) and the 
[GNU Bash Manual](http://gnu.org/s/bash/manual).
[shellcheck.net](https://www.shellcheck.net/) provides a web interface 
(and binary for some distros) that checks shell scripts for errors or 
common issues and provides information on how to best correct them.
