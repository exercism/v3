Elm describes itself as a "delightful language for reliable webapps".
It aims at producing web applications with great performances and no runtime exception.

Concretely, it is a functional programming language compiling to JavaScript.
Its syntax and features originated from the ML family of languages, such as Haskell,
but with [a strong emphasis on learnability and simplicity][blog-syntax].
