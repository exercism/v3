# Concepts of grade-school

[Example implementation](https://exercism.io/tracks/elm/exercises/grade-school/solutions/e9c90282d4e14220b798cc8382130b03)

## Basics

- imports: being able to import other modules such as Dict or Set
- exposing: to expose the functions to test
- functions: define functions

## Computation

- sort: sort lists or retrieve sorted lists from other data structures
- let expressions: define local variables and functions
- chaining computation: using piping (|>)
- partial application: combined with chaining of computation

## Types

- type alias: to define the `Grade`, `Student` and `School` types
- type annotations: define the types of functions
- Int: used for grades
- String: used for students
- Dict: using the grades as keys
- Set: to store all students of a grade
- List: to display students, and mapping on a list
- Maybe: for most Dict and Set operations
- Tuple: return pairs
