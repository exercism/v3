# How to implement an Elm concept exercise

This document describes the steps required to implement a concept exercise for the Elm track.

**Please please please read the docs before starting.** Posting PRs without reading these docs will be a lot more frustrating for you during the review cycle, and exhaust Exercism's maintainers' time. So, before diving into the implementation, please read the following documents:

- [The features of v3][docs-features-of-v3].
- [Rationale for v3][docs-rationale-for-v3].
- [What are concept exercise and how they are structured?][docs-concept-exercises]

Please also watch the following video:

- [The Anatomy of a Concept Exercise][anatomy-of-a-concept-exercise].

As this document is generic, the following placeholders are used:

- `<SLUG>`: the name of the exercise in kebab-case (e.g. `anonymous-methods`).
- `<NAME>`: the name of the exercise in PascalCase (e.g. `AnonymousMethods`).

Before implementing the exercise, please make sure you have a good understanding of what the exercise should be teaching (and what not). This information can be found in the exercise's GitHub issue.

Any concept exercise in any v3 track requires the following files to be created:

<pre>
languages
└── elm
    └── exercises
        └── concept
            └── &lt;SLUG&gt;
                ├── .docs
                |   ├── instructions.md
                |   ├── introduction.md
                |   ├── hints.md
                |   ├── after.md
                |   └── source.md (required if there are third-party sources)
                └── .meta
                |   └── config.json
                |   └── design.md
                |   └── Example.elm
                ├── elm.json
                ├── src
                |   └── &lt;NAME&gt;.elm
                └── tests
                    └── &lt;NAME&gt;.elm
</pre>

## Step 1: adding code files

The code files are track-specific and should be designed to help the student learn the exercise's concepts. The following Elm code files must be created (not necessarily in this order):

- An `elm.json` file.
- A stub implementation file (`src/<NAME>.elm`).
- A file containing the test suite (`tests/<NAME>.elm`).
- An example implementation file that passes all the tests (`.meta/Example.elm`).

## Step 2: adding documentation files

How to create the files common to all tracks is described in the [how to implement a concept exercise document][how-to-implement-a-concept-exercise].

## Step 3: add analyzer (optional)

Some exercises could benefit from having an exercise-specific analyzer. If so, please check the track's analyzer document for details on how to do this.

_Skip this step if you're not sure what to do._

## Step 4: add representation (optional)

Some exercises could benefit from having a custom representation as generated by the track's representer. If so, please check the track's representer document for details on how to do this.

_Skip this step if you're not sure what to do._

## Inspiration

When implementing an exercise, it can be very useful to look at the exercises the track has already implemented. You can also check the exercise's [general concepts documents][reference] to see if other languages that have already an exercise for that concept.
