The best way to get started with Ceylon right now is to read the [quick introduction](http://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/1.3/introduction/),
then [take the tour](http://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/1.3/tour/) and/or [the walkthrough](http://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/1.3/walkthrough/).

You can write and run your first programs in our [web IDE](http://try.ceylon-lang.org/)
so you don't even have to install anything to get started.

And of course you can contact the team and other users at our [Gitter page](https://gitter.im/ceylon/user).
