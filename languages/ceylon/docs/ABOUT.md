Ceylon is a general-purpose programming language featuring a syntax similar to Java and C#.
It is imperative, statically-typed, block-structured, object-oriented, and higher-order.
By _statically-typed_, we mean that the compiler performs extensive type checking, with
the help of type annotations that appear in the code. By _object-oriented_, we mean that
the language supports user-defined types and features a nominative type system where a type
is a set of named attributes and operations, and that it supports inheritance and subtype
polymorphism. By _higher-order_, we mean that every referenceable program element
(every attribute, every operation, and every type) is also a value. By _block-structured_,
we mean to say that the language features lexical scoping and an extremely regular recursive
syntax for declarations and statements.

Ceylon improves upon the Java language and type system to reduce verbosity and increase
typesafety compared to Java and C#. Ceylon encourages a more functional, somewhat less
imperative style of programming, resulting in code which is easier to reason about, and
easier to refactor.
