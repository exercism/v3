The easiest way to install Ceylon is simply to **not** install it.
You should be able to solve most of the exercises using our [web IDE](http://try.ceylon-lang.org/).

However if you prefer, you can install the command line distribution; the easiest way to do that is via [SDKMAN](http://sdkman.io/),
so you need to install that first if you don't have it yet, then just type `sdk install ceylon` at your terminal.

OSX users can also install via the [Homebrew package manager](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).

Installation instructions for other platforms, as well as for the Ceylon IDE, a plugin for Eclipse, are available at [the official site](http://ceylon-lang.org/download/).
