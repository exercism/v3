Welcome to [Pharo](http://www.pharo.org), an environment and language that embraces creativity, exploration and fun.

It features a world that is:

- **Simple and Powerful:** No constructors, type declarations, interfaces or primitive types. Yet it's a powerful and elegant language with a full syntax that fits on a [postcard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pharo_syntax_postcard.svg)! The magic is objects and messages all the way down.

- **Live and Immersive:** Immediate feedback at any moment of your development: Developing, testing, exploring, debugging. Even in live environments, you don't have to wait to compile and deploy!

- **Amazing for Debugging:** The [debugger](https://medium.com/@richardeng/how-to-use-the-pharo-debugger-eb554a2950b6) is unlike anything you've seen before. While it lets you step through code, you can also restart execution at any point, create methods and classes on the fly, and even extend its abilities. 

- **Rich in History but Forward Looking:** Many concepts originated from Smalltalk like: [MVC](http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~trygver/themes/mvc/mvc-index.html), [JIT](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Just-in-time_compilation) compilation, Live coding, [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUnit), [Refactoring](http://www.academia.edu/10644191/A_Refactoring_Tool_for_Smalltalk); however we are still looking ahead with [moldable tools](https://gtoolkit.com/), [GtSpotter](http://www.humane-assessment.com/blog/introducing-gtspotter), [Agile Visualisation](http://agilevisualization.com/), and [MetaLinks](https://www.slideshare.net/MarcusDenker/lecture-metalinks) to name a few...

- **Active, Friendly, Helpful Community:** Pharo is yours, made by an incredible [community](http://pharo.org/community), with more than 100 contributors on the last revision and many more constantly [contributing](http://pharo.org/contribute) with frameworks, libraries and advice.

Still not convinced? Pharo has a rich and fascinating [history](http://worrydream.com/EarlyHistoryOfSmalltalk/), that has influenced most of today's languages and techniques in one form or another. [Learning the source](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/950145591379742727) of these ideas is the road to being a good programmer in any language. But most of all, it's just incredibly fun! Why not join in?
