Objective-C is a thin layer on top of C, and is a "strict superset" of C, meaning that it is possible to compile any C program with an Objective-C compiler, and to freely include C language code within an Objective-C class. 
Objective-C derives its object syntax from Smalltalk. 
All of the syntax for non-object-oriented operations (including primitive variables, pre-processing, expressions, function declarations, and function calls) is identical to that of C, while the syntax for object-oriented features is an implementation of Smalltalk-style messaging. 

You can find more information about the language and its history [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C).
