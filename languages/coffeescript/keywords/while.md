# `while`

The only low-level [loop][concept-loops] that CoffeeScript provides is the while loop. The main difference from [JavaScript][language-javascript] is that the `while` loop can be used as an expression, returning an [array][type-array] containing the result of each [iteration through the loop][concept-enumeration].
