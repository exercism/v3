In Javascript, an array is a list-like structure with no fixed length which can hold any type of primitives or ojects, even mixed types. The array elements can be accesed by their index.

Examples of equivalent declaration:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 'two', 3, 'four']; // most common`
const numbers = new Array(1, 'two', 3, 'four');
```
