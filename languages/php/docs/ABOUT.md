PHP is a server-side language suited towards web development. The acronym is recursive, standing for _PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor_.

Considerably more versatile than CGI scripting, PHP is often used to add interactivity to plain HTML and bolster web frameworks.

The language can be employed on any operating system. PHP is supported by most common web servers and is often handled through an interpreter module. This combines static web code with dynamic inclusions.

PHP isn't just a web server framework. It's also useful for command-line scripting (headless parsing) and developing GUIs.

You should learn PHP because:

- it's an Open Source language
- it's well-documented and supported
- it's compatible with most common web servers
- it's easy to pick up and start learning
- it's highly scalable and extensible
