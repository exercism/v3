## Installing [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org)


In addition to the exercism CLI and your favorite text editor, practicing with Exercism exercises in Scala requires:

* Recent build of the Java 8 Platform, such as [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/install/) or [Oracle Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) 
* [Download](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Setup.html) and install the Simple Build Tool (`sbt`)

---

After installing Java and `sbt` you will be ready to get started with the Scala track of Exercism.

To get started, see "[Running the Tests](http://exercism.io/languages/scala/tests)".
