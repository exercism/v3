## Recommended Learning Resources

Exercism provides exercises and feedback but can be difficult to jump into for those learning Scala for the first time. These resources can help you get started:

* [Scala - Getting Started](http://www.scala-lang.org/documentation/getting-started.html)
* [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
* [Scala Exercises](https://www.scala-exercises.org/std_lib)
* [The Neophyte's Guide to Scala](http://danielwestheide.com/scala/neophytes.html)

## Linting

Scala projects can be linted for further code analysis via a third party tool - [Scalastyle](http://www.scalastyle.org/).

There are several ways of using Scalastyle including Maven, SBT, Gradle, IntelliJ and Eclipse. For instructions on usage visit [Scalastyle](http://www.scalastyle.org/).
