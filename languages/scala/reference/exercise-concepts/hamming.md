# Concepts of hamming

[Example implementation](https://github.com/exercism/scala/blob/master/exercises/hamming/example.scala)

## General

- object or case class: used as class wrapper for exercies
- functions: used as main entry point for the exercise
- function arguments: input strands passed as arguments
- return values: return a value from a function
- conditionals using if: conditionally execute logic using an `if` statement
- strings: `string` passed as the two input parameters
- character operations: `!=`
- integer: `Int` is used as return result within `Option`
- Option: `Option` is used as return result
- math operations: `==`
- zip: combine two strings into a sequence of tuples
- count: count number of lambda calls that return true
- lambda: define lambda to compare characters

## Using `filter` and `size` to count differences

- filter: remove matching characters from zipped sequence
- lambda: define lambda to compare characters
- size: calculate size of sequence

# Using range and count to count differences

- range: define range of indexes to stream over
- count: count number of lambda calls that return true
- lamda: define lambda the returns true if characters in strings are different
- index: index character in string using position
