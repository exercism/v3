- function arguments: input strands passed as arguments
- return values: return a value from a function
- Char: single character, manipulate text
- parameter scope: use of `private`
- foldRight: collapse a sequence from inside to outside
- pattern matching: handle a value differently if it fits a specific pattern
- for comprehension: yield a sequence matching certain conditions
- Map: to store key/value pairs
