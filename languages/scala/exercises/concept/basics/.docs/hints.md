## General

- An integer value can be defined as one or more consecutive digits.

## 1. Define the expected oven time in minutes

- You need to define a [method][methods] without any arguments.
- You need to return an integer value (see [built-in types]).

## 2. Calculate the remaining oven time in minutes

- You need to define a [method][methods] with a single parameter.
- The method's parameter is an integer.
- You need to return an integer value (see [built-in types]).
- You can use the `-` operator to subtract values.

## 3. Calculate the preparation time in minutes

- You need to define a [method][methods] with a single parameter.
- The method's parameter is an integer.
- You need to return an integer value (see [built-in types]).
- You can use the `*` operator to multiply values.

## 4. Calculate the elapsed time in minutes

- You need to define a [method][methods] with two parameters.
- The method's parameters are of type integer.
- You need to return an integer value (see [built-in types]).
- You can [invoke][invocation] one of the other methods you've defined previously.
- You can use the `+` operator to add values.
