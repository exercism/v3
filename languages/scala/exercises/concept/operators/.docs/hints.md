## General

- In every task you need to define a new instance of the `Rectangle` class with the correct width and height constructor arguments. This new rectangle serves as the return value.

## 1. Create a plus operator for rectangles

- The new rectangle's width needs to be the sum of the current rectangle and the method argument's rectangle.
- The new rectangle's height can be taken from the current rectangle.

## 2. Enhance the plus operator

- In order to determine the maximum value of two numbers, check the [Scala math] package.

## 3. Create a multiply operator for rectangles

- The new rectangle's width and height need to be multiplied each by the given `factor` parameter.
