# Windows

1. Open a Command Prompt and get the first exercise:

     ```batchfile
     C:\Users\JohnDoe>exercism fetch ballerina

     Not Submitted:     1 problem
     ballerina (Hello World) C:\Users\JohnDoe\exercism\ballerina\hello-world

     New:               1 problem
     ballerina (Hello World) C:\Users\JohnDoe\exercism\ballerina\hello-world

     unchanged: 0, updated: 0, new: 1
   ```

2. Change directory into the ballerina exercism main directory:

     ```batchfile
     C:\Users\JohnDoe>cd C:\Users\JohnDoe\exercism\ballerina
     ```
3. Initialize the project prior to executing tests:

     ```batchfile
     C:\Users\JohnDoe\exercism\ballerina> ballerina init
     ```
     
4. Run the tests:

     ```batchfile
     C:\Users\JohnDoe\exercism\ballerina>ballerina test hello-world 
     ```
   *(Don't worry about the tests failing, at first, this is how you begin each exercise.)*

5. Solve the exercise.  Find and work through the `TUTORIAL.md` guide ([view on GitHub](https://github.com/exercism/ballerina/blob/master/exercises/hello-world/TUTORIAL.md)).


Good luck!  Have fun!
