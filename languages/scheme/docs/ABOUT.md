Scheme is a statically scoped and properly tail\-recursive dialect of the Lisp programming language invented by Guy Lewis Steele Jr\. and Gerald Jay Sussman\.
It was designed to have an exceptionally clear and simple semantics and few different ways to form expressions\.
A wide variety of programming paradigms, including functional, imperative, and message passing styles, find convenient expression in Scheme\.
