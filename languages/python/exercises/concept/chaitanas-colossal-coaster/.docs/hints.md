# General

Make sure you have a good understanding of how to create and manipulate lists.

## 1. Add Me to the queue

- You need to find the ticket type with an `if-else` statement.
- You can `append` the person to the queue based on the ticket type.

## 2. Where are my friends

- You need to find the `index` of the friend name from the queue.

## 3. Can I please join them?

- Since you know the `index`, you need to `insert` the friend to the index in the queue.

## 4. Mean person in the queue

- You know the mean person name, you have to `remove` them from the queue.

# 5. Namefellows

- All you need is to `count` the occurrences of the name in the queue.

## 6. Remove the last person

- Since you know that you need to remove the last person in the queue, you need to `pop` him/her out.

## 7. Sort the Queue List

- You need to `sort` the queue and return the sorted list.
- The order is alphabetical, hence it should be sorted in ascending order.
