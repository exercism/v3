# Introduction

A `str` typed object in Python is an immutable sequence of Unicode code points. This could include letters, numbers, punctuation, etc. To manipulate strings, Python provides string methods that can transform a string into other types, create new strings based on method arguments, or return information about the string. Python operators are also overloaded to provide the ability to use them with strings, e.g. to add them together with `+`.

Immutability means that a string's value doesn't change; methods that appear to modify a string actually return a new instance of `str`.
