In this lesson, we learned:
 - Python has a `str` type.
 - How to find items in a string.
 - How to manipulate strings to create new strings.
 - Where to find documentation about string methods.

## More about strings

It's useful to become familiar with Python's string instance methods, formatting, and literal syntax. For a deep dive on what information a string is encoding (or, "how does the computer know how to translate zeroes and ones into letters?"), [this blog post is enduringly helpful](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/).

### More about Python logging

Python has a useful built-in logging library, aptly-named `logging`. It handles cases similar
to the ones you're working on, and more. It's very often used in projects, and is worthwhile to know.
