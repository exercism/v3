A `dict` object in Python is a mutable\* mapping of unique keys to values. A key is basically a name for a value. A value can be any type of object, like `strings`, `ints`, `lists`, etc. Dictionaries have different methods to change them, like getting a value from a specific key in the dictionary, setting a default value for a key and many more. Dictionaries are also iterable by their keys.

\*_Mutable objects are objects that can be changed without changing their identity. Methods for immutable objects actually dont return any value (like with strings) they change the object itself._
