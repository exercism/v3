Python is a [dynamic and strongly](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11328920/is-python-strongly-typed) typed [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) programming language. It supports both imperative (_object-oriented, procedural_) and declarative (_functional, concurrent_) programming paradigms. Python emphasizes code readability and (similar to Haskell) uses significant indentation.

Objects are [assigned](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#assignment-statements) to names in Python via the `=` or _assignment operator_. _Variables_ are written in [`snake_case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case), and _constants_ (usually) in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`. A name (_variable or constant_) is not itself _typed_, and can be attached or re-attached to different objects over its lifetime:

```python
>>> my_first_variable = 1
>>> my_first_variable = {"bear" : "brown", "cat": "black"}
>>> my_first_variable = collections.Counter()
>>> my_first_variable = "Last one, I promise"
>>> print(my_first_variable)
"Last one, I promise"
```

Constants are usually defined at the top of a script or file, and although they _can_ be changed, they are _intended_ to be named only once. Their `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` is a message to other developers that the assignment should not be altered:

```python
# All caps signal that this is intended as a constant
MY_FIRST_CONSTANT = 16

# Re-assignment will be allowed by the compiler & interpreter,
# but is VERY strongly discouraged.
# Please don't do: MY_FIRST_CONSTANT = "Some other value"
```

In Python, units of functionality are encapsulated in [functions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#function). When functions are bound to a [class](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#classes) name, they're referred to as [methods](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/method.html#method-objects).

The keyword `def` begins a [function definition](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions). It must be followed by the function name and a parenthesized list of zero or more formal [parameters](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-parameter). The `def` line is terminated with a colon. Statements for the _body_ of the function begin on the next line, and must be _indented in a block_. Functions explicitly return a value or object via the `return` keyword:

```python
#function definition on first line.
def add_two_numbers(number_one, number_two):
    return number_one + number_two  #returns the sum of the numbers

>>> add_two_numbers(3, 4)
7
```

Functions are _called_ using their name followed by `()`. The number of arguments passed in the parentheses must match the number of parameters in the original function definition:

```python
def number_to_the_power_of(number_one, number_two):
    '''Returns float or int.

       Takes number_one and raises it to the power of number_two, returning the result.
    '''
    return number_one ** number_two

>>> number_to_the_power_of(3,3)
27

>>> number_to_the_power_of(4,)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: number_to_the_power_of() missing 1 required positional argument: 'number_two'
```

Comments in Python start with a `#` (_hash character_) that is not part of a string, and end at line termination. Unlike many other programming languages, Python does not support multi-line comment marks. Each line of a comment block must start with the `#` character. Comments are ignored by the interpreter:

```python
#this is a single line comment

x = "foo"  #this is an in-line comment

#this is a multi-line
#comment block over multiple lines
#these should be used sparingly
```

The first statement of a function body can optionally be a [docstring](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#tut-docstrings), which concisely summarizes the function or object's purpose. These docstrings are read by automated documentation tools, and are returned by calling `__doc__` on the function, method, or class. They are recommended for programs of any size where documentation is needed:

```python
def number_to_the_power_of(number_one, number_two):
    '''Returns float or int.

       Takes number_one and raises it to the power of number_two, returning the result.
    '''
    return number_one ** number_two

>>> print(number_to_the_power_of.__doc__)
Returns float or int.

       Takes number_one and raises it to the power of number_two, returning the result.

>>> print(str.__doc__)
str(object='') -> str
str(bytes_or_buffer[, encoding[, errors]]) -> str

Create a new string object from the given object. If encoding or
errors is specified, then the object must expose a data buffer
that will be decoded using the given encoding and error handler.
Otherwise, returns the result of object.__str__() (if defined)
or repr(object).
encoding defaults to sys.getdefaultencoding().
errors defaults to 'strict'.
```
