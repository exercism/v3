## General

- [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html) can be a great introduction.
- [Numbers](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#numbers) in Python can be integers, floats, or complex.

## 1. Define expected bake time in minutes

- You need to [name](https://realpython.com/python-variables/) a constant, and [assign](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-assignment-stmt) it an integer value.

## 2. Calculate remaining bake time in minutes

- You need to define a [function](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions) with a single parameter representing the time elapsed so far.
- Use the [mathematical operator for subtraction](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#numbers) to subtract values.
- This function should `return` a value.

## 3. Calculate preparation time in minutes

- You need to define a [function](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions) with a single parameter representing the number of layers.
- Use the [mathematical operator for multiplication](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#numbers) to multiply values.
- You could define an extra _constant_ for the time in minutes per layer rather than using a "magic number" in your code.
- This function should `return` a value.

## 4. Calculate total elapsed cooking time (prep + bake) in minutes

- You need to define a [function](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions) with two parameters.
- Remember: you can always _call_ a function you've defined previously.
- You can use the [mathematical operator for addition](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction) to sum values.
- This function should `return` a value.

## 5. Add docstrings and comments to your work

- Clearly [commenting](https://realpython.com/python-comments-guide/) and [documenting](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#tut-docstrings) your code is always recommended.
