## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the basics of the `List` (sequence type) data type in Python. The exercise will walk the student through how to create lists via various methods, iterate through lists via looping, and access items in various lists through indexing and forming/accessing list slices.

## Learning objectives

- Create a `list` via constructor (`list()`) & literal (`[]`)
- Combine two or more lists by concatenation via `+`
- Check for an items membership/absence in a list using `in` and/or `not in`
- Access items in a list via index (`bracket notation`)
- Access a range of items in a list via list slicing (`[start:stop:step]`)
- Iterate through a list using `for item in`
- Understand that `lists` can store mixed/any data types
- Understand that `lists` are mutable. Assigning a new value to a list index will change the value at that index. 

## Out of scope

- List Comprehensions (these will be covered in their own concept exercise)
- List methods (`copy()`, `append()`, `sort()` etc)
- How builtin functions relate to lists (`len()`, `max()`, `min()`, `count()`, `sorted()`)
- Construction of complex or nested `lists` (i.e a `list` of `dicts`, a `list` of `lists`, a `list` of `tuples`)
- Consequences and considerations of mutability
