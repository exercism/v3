## General

## 1. Creating a List

- `Lists` in python may be [constructed](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list) in several ways.
- This function should [return](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_return.asp) a `list`.

## 2. Creating a copy of a List

- `Lists` can be [nested](https://realpython.com/python-lists-tuples/#lists-can-be-nested), this means that a `list` can be an element of another `list`.
- This function should [return](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_return.asp) a `list` containing two `lists`.

## 3. Concatenating Lists

- Sequence types such as `list` already support a few [common operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range)
- This function should [return](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_return.asp) a `list`.

## 4. Testing List Membership

- Sequence types such as `list` already support a few [common operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range)
- This function should [return](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_return.asp) a `boolean`.

## 5. Accessing List Elements by Index

- Sequence types such as `list` already support a few [common operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range)
- To access an element use the square brackets notation.
- Remember that the first element of the `list` is at index 0
- In python, negative indexing starts the count from the end. This mean that you can find the last element of the `list` at index -1.
- This function should [return](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_return.asp) a `list` containig two elements.

## 6. Accessing Sublists by Slicing

- Sequence types such as `list` already support a few [common operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range)
- For the last part of the exercise, think about reusing the code from the functions that you just implemented.
- These function should [return](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_return.asp) a `list`.

## 7. Iterating Over List Items

- There are a few techniques to [iterate over a `list` in python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterate-over-a-list-in-python/).
- You should use the function `print` on each element of the `list` to print each of them on a separate line.
- This function should not [return](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_return.asp) anything so you should end it with just the statement `return`.

## 8. Creating Lists with Mixed Data Types

- There are many [built-in types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html) in python.
- [`Lists` Can Contain Arbitrary Objects](https://realpython.com/python-lists-tuples/#lists-can-contain-arbitrary-objects).
- This function should [return](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_return.asp) a `list`.

## 9. Modifying Values in Lists

- `Lists` in python are mutable, this means that once a `list` is created, you can modify, delete or add any element as you wish. 
- Python provides a wide range of [ways to modify `lists`](https://realpython.com/python-lists-tuples/#lists-are-mutable).
- This function should not [return](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_return.asp) anything so you should end it with the statement `return` alone.
