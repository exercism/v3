## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student how [`bool`](https://github.com/exercism/v3/blob/master/languages/python/reference/concepts/builtin_types/bool.md) is implemented and used in Python. We will teach the `bool` type by showing the student how to use it.

## Learning objectives

- create a `bool` object via literal declaration
- obtain a `bool` object from using [logical operators](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#boolean-operations) (`and`, `or`, `not`)

## Out of scope

- obtain a `bool` object from [comparison operators](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#value-comparisons) (`>`, `<`, `==`)
- obtain a `bool` object from [membership operators](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#membership-test-operations) (`in`, `not in`)
- obtain a `bool` object from [identity operators](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#is-not) (`is`, `is not`)
- 'truthyness' and 'falsyness'
  - create a `bool` object from other objects (`collections`, `integers`, `strings`) with the the `bool()` constructor.
- catching/raising Exceptions
- covering that `bool` is a subtype of `int`
- bitwise logical operators
- orders of evaluation

## Concepts

- **booleans:** know of the existence of the bool type and its two values; know about boolean operators and how to build logical expressions with them; know of the boolean operator precedence rules.

## Prerequisites

- `basics`
- `comparison-operators`
