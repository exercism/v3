Comments are part of every programming language. They provide important information about the program to its stakeholders. Every programmer has a different habit of logging comments in the program. Some organizations insist programmers log little detail as possible. So the next programmers would not get confused with the previous person's work.
Comment is part of the program where part of the information is omitted by the compiler in the compilation.
Organizations prefer to put build date, contributorâ€™s name, deployment date in their comments. A good programmer will log little details as possible so he won't get confused when complexity increases in programming.
