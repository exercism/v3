## General

- Make sure you are comfortable with using the `in` concept while looping through in for loops.

You are a teacher and you are correcting papers of your students who wrote an exam you just conducted. You are tasked with the following activities.

## 1. Failed Students

- Iterate through the marks one by one. For each loop check if the mark is less than or equal to 40. If so, then increment a count and after iterating through all marks in the loop return the count.

## 2. Top Marks

- Iterate through the list of marks one by one. If you find a mark which is more than x, just continue and go to the next mark.

## 3. First K Students.

- Start an index variable at 0 and loop through the elements till we reach the index variable equals to k. once that happens you can return the marks.

## 4. Full Marks

- There may be or may not be a student with full marks - 100. Either way you have to loop through all the marks and find whether we have a student with full marks else just return No Hundreds
