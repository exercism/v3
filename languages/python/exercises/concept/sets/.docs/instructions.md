Aazra and Rui are teammates competing in a pirate-themed treasure hunt. One has a list of treasures with map coordinates, the other a list of location names with map coordinates. They've also been given blank maps with a starting place marked YOU ARE HERE.

But things are a bit disorganized: Azara's coordinates appear to be formatted and sorted differently from Rui's, and they have to keep looking from one list to the other to figure out which treasures go with which locations. Being budding pythonistas, they've come to you for help in writing a small program (a set of functions, really) to better organize their hunt information.

## 1. Extract coordinates

Implement the `get_cooordinate()` function that takes a `(treasure, coordinate)` pair from Azaras list and returns only the extracted map coordinate.
​

```python
>>> get_coordinate(("Scrimshaw Whale's Tooth", "2A"))
"2A"
```

## 2. Format coordinates

Implement the `convert_coordinate()` function that takes a coordinate in the format "2A" and returns a tuple in the format `("2", "A")`.

​

```python
>>> convert_coordinate("2A")
("2", "A")
```

## 3. Match coordinates

Implement the `compare_records()` function that takes a `(treasure, coordinate)` pair and a `(location, coordinate, quadrant)` record and compares coordinates from each. Return **`True`** if the coordinates "match", and return **`False`** if they do not. Re-format coordinates as needed for accurate comparison.

```python
>>> compare_records(('Brass Spyglass', '4B'),('Seaside Cottages', ("1", "C"), 'blue'))
False

>>> compare_records(('Model Ship in Large Bottle', '8A'), ('Harbor Managers Office', ("8", "A"), 'purple'))
True
```

## 4. Combine matched records

Implement the `create_record()` function that takes a `(treasure, coordinate)` pair from Azaras list and a `(location, coordinate, quadrant)` record from Ruis list and returns `(treasure, coordinate, location, coordinate, quadrant)` **if the coordinates match**. If the coordinats _do not_ match, return the string "not a match.". Re-format the coordinate as needed for accurate comparison.

```python
>>> create_record(('Brass Spyglass', '4B'),('Abandoned Lighthouse', ("4", "B"), 'Blue'))
('Brass Spyglass', '4B', 'Abandoned Lighthouse', ("4", "B"), 'Blue')

>>> create_record(('Brass Spyglass', '4B'),(("1", "C"), 'Seaside Cottages', 'blue'))
"not a match."
```

## 5. "Clean up" & make a report of all records

Clean up the combined records from Azara and Rui so that there's only one set of coordinates per record. Make a report so they can see one list of everything they need to put on their maps.
Implement the `clean_up()` function that takes a tuple of tuples (_everything from both lists_), looping through the _outer_ tuple, dropping the unwanted coordinates from each _inner_ tuple and adding each to a 'report'. Format and return the 'report' so that there is one cleaned record on each line.

```python
>>> clean_up((('Brass Spyglass', '4B', 'Abandoned Lighthouse', '("4", "B")', 'Blue'), ('Vintage Pirate Hat', '7E', 'Quiet Inlet (Island of Mystery)', '("7", "E")', 'Orange'), ('Crystal Crab', '6A', 'Old Schooner', '("6", "A")', 'Purple')))

"""
('Brass Spyglass', 'Abandoned Lighthouse', '("4", "B")', 'Blue')\n
('Vintage Pirate Hat', 'Quiet Inlet (Island of Mystery)', '("7", "E")', 'Orange')\n
('Crystal Crab', 'Old Schooner', '("6", "A")','Purple')\n
"""
```
