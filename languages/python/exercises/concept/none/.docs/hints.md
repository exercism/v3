## General

- Don't worry about how the arguments are derived, just focus on combining the arguments to return the intended result.

## 1. Find the empty Seat

- You need to loop through the list one by one and first the first occurance of None.

## 2. Assign the seat

- Since you know the index for which you need to assign None, you can just do list[seat_num + 1] to None.
