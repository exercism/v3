## General

Uptil now most program examples seen in the concept exercises ran in a sequential manner. Where code executed on after the other. However, this doesn't allow for implimentation of more complex logic. Conditional statments allows program to execute different lines of code based on some factors. Python uses `if/else` statements to achive this.

Lets look at basic structure of pythons ``if/else` and lets make a real world analogy.

```python
if <expression>:
    <statement 1>
else:
    <statment 2>
```

A real world analogy to `if/else` statment is like this. If its sunny outside, then go to park. Otherwise read a book.

Here in real world scenario. The expression is "weather it is sunny or not". If it is sunny go outside and that will be the python equivalent of a statment 1 and if its not sunny we read a book which is equivalent to the staement 2.
