In this exercise, we will develop a simple control system for a nuclear reactor.

For a reactor to produce the power it must be in a state of criticality. 
If the reactor becomes less than criticality it can damage the reactor. 
If it goes beyond criticality it can result in a meltdown.

You have three task, all related to maintaining the criticality of the reactor.

<!-- Problem 1 to teach basic if condition -->
## 1. Check for criticality

The first thing a control system must do is to check if the reactor is critical. 
A reactor is said to be critical if it satisfies the following conditions.
- Temperature less than 800
- Number of neutrons emitted per second greater than 500
- The product of temperature and neutrons emitted per second less than 50000

Implement a function called `is_critical()` that takes in 2 arguments the temperature and neutrons emitted per second and returns a boolean True or False 

```python
>>> is_critical(750,600)
True
```

<!-- For teaching elif -->
## 2. Determine the Power output range

Now that the reactor has started producing power we need to determine the efficiency of the reactor.
The efficency can be grouped into 4 bands.
- green -> 80-100% efficency
- orange -> 60-80% efficency
- red -> 30-60% efficency
- black -> <30% efficent

efficency is calculated as `(generated power/ theoretical max power)*100`
where generated `power = voltage * current`

Implement a function called `reactor_efficency()` that takes in 3 arguments: `voltage`, `current`, and `theoretical_max_power`. The function returns the efficiency band of the reactor either 'green', 'orange', 'red', 'black'

```python
>>> reactor_efficency(200,50,1500)
'orange'
```

<!-- Intention is to teach use of if, elif and else -->
## 3. Fail Safe Mechanism

The final part involves creating a fail-safe mechanism. We can increase/decrease or stop the criticality state of a reactor by inserting control rods into the reactor. 

Implement a function called `fail_safe()` which takes in 3 parameters: `temperature`, `neutrons produced per second`, and `threshold` to outputs status codes.

- If `temperature * neutrons per second` < 40% of threshold, output a status code of 'LOW' indicating that the control rods must be removed to make it go critical and produce power

- If `temperature * neutrons per second` are within plus or minus 10% of the `threshold` the reactor is in criticality and outputs a status code of 'NORMAL' , indicating that the reactor is in optimum condition and control rods are in an idea position

- If `temperature * neutron per second` is not in the above-stated ranges. The reactor is going into meltdown and a status code of 'DANGER' must be passed to immediately shut down the reactor
