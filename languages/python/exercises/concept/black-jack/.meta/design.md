## Goal

This concept exercise should teach how basic _non-customized_ comparisons work in python and how to use them effectively.

## Learning objectives

- understand all comparison operations in Python have the same priority and are evaluated after arithmetic, shifting, or bitwise operations.
- understand all comparisons yield the boolean values True and False
- know that identity comparisons is and is not are for checking an objects identity only
- understand that `==` and `!=` compare both the value & type of an object.
- know where Python has altered the behavior of `==` and `!=` for certain `built-in` types (such as [numbers](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesnumeric)), or for standard library types like [decimals](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#decimal.Decimal), and [fractions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html#fractions.Fraction) to allow comparison across and within type.
- know that unlike numeric types, strings (`str`) and binary sequences (`bytes` & `byte array`) **cannot** be directly compared.
- understand how comparisons work within `built-in` [sequence types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range) (`list`, `tuple`, `range`) and `built-in` `collection types` (`set`, `[dict]`)
- know about the "special" comparisons `None`, `NotImplemented` (comparing either should use identity operators and not equality operators because they are singleton objects) and NaN (`NaN` is **never** `==` to itself)
- use the value comparison operators `==`, `>`, `<`, `!=` with numeric types
- use the value comparison operators `==`, `>`, `<`, `!=` with non-numeric types
- use `is` and `is not` to check/verify identity

## Out of scope

- rich comparison with `__lt__`, `__le__`, `__ne__`, `__ge__`, `__gt__`
- understanding (_and using the concept_) that the `==` operator calls the dunder method `__eq__()` on a specific object, and uses that object's implementation for comparison. Where no implementation is present, the default `__eq__()` from generic `object` is used.
- overloading the default implementation of the `__eq__()` dunder method on a specific object to customize comparison behavior.
- `set operations`
- performance considerations

## Concepts

- Comparison priority in Python
- Comparison operators `==`, `>`, `<`, `!=`
- Identity methods `is` and `is not`
- Equality applied to `built-in` types
- Equivalence vs equality
- Inequality
