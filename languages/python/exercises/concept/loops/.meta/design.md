## Goal

This concept exercise should convey a basic understanding of how to handle loops in Python. This concept exercise should therefore teach the student the python while loops, for loops and should also teach how to interrupt or change the normal flow of a loop.

## Learning objectives

- use the while key to execute a loop: execute something as long as an expression is true
- use a for loop to iterate over an iterable object with the for ... in pattern. The Membership testing concept (in) is required to address this concept.
- understand the differences between while (condition-dependent) and for (length or iteration dependent) loops
- use the break statement to terminate the nearest enclosing loop
- use the continue statement to continue with the next cycle of the nearest enclosing loop
- use the else clause to perform operation when a for loop terminates

## Out of scope

- async loops (advanced)

## Concepts

- while loops
- for loops
- the else clause to perform operation when the loop terminates
- break statement
- continue statement

## Prerequisites

- iterable objects and iteration base knowledge
- collections
- the Membership testing concept (in)
