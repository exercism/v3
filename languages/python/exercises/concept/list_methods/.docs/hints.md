# General

- Make sure you have good understanding of creating lists and manipulating them.

## 1. Add Me to the queue

- You need to find the ticket type with basic if else statement.
- You can then add or `append` the person to the queue based on the ticket type.

## 2. We came as a Group

- You need to extend your list. That is, you have an iterable number of names that you need to extend to your existing queue.

## 3. Where are my friends

- You need to find the `index` of the friend name from the queue.

## 4. Can I please join with them?

- Since you know the `index`, you need to `insert` the friend to the index in the queue.

## 5. Mean person in the queue

- You know the name of the person who is mean. you have to just `remove` them from the queue.

# 6. DoppelGangers

- The number of people with the same name can be 0 till the whole queue length. All you need to do is find the `count` or the occurances of the name in the queue.

## 7. Remove the last guy

- Since you know that you need to remove the last person on the queue, you just need to `pop` him/her out.

## 9. New Ride Begins

- First, you need to copy the person names from the original queue into a new queue,
- You then have to `extend` or `append` one by one the extra people who are waiting for the new ride.

## 10. Sort the Queue List

- Since the order is unspecified, it is in ascending order, hence you need to `sort` the queue and return.
