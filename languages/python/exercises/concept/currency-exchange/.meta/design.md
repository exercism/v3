## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student how to use arithmetic operators and type casting between `int` and `float` in Python

## Learning objectives

- use `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` to add, subtract, multiply, divide numbers(`int` and `float`).
- use `int()` to cast `float` to `int`.
- use `%` to calculate remainders.
