## Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach helpful methods string manipulation methods and how to use them in Python.  


## Learning objectives
- Know the string class and its core methods
- Know when to use methods of str to operate on a string

use several of the methods from each grouping below to operate on strings:
check if a given string ends/begins with the a specified suffix/prefix with the endswith()/startswith() methods
check if a given string is composed of certain code points/characters by using isalnum(), isalph(), isascii(), isdecimal(), isdigit(), or isnumeric() methods.
return a new string that is a transform of the input string using capitalize(), lower(), casefold(), swapcase(), upper(), or title() methods
return a new string that has leading/trailing whitespaces removed with lstrip(), rstrip(), or strip()methods
check if a given substring is contained within a given string using in
return a new string that replaces a given substring with a new value using the replace() method
build a new string from an input iterable with join()


## Out of scope
- string formatting methods, "f-strings", "format strings"
- string splitting
- string translate methods (will have their own exercise)
- string constants from the string module
- built-ins that can take a str as an argument
- encoding/decoding & codecs
- the binary sequence types bytes, bytearray, and memoryview
- binary transforms and text transforms
- text encodings

## Concepts
- `str`
- methods
- immutable/immutability
- unicode code point

## Prerequisites
- `booleans`
- `strings`
- `sequences`, `sequence type`
- `iteration`
