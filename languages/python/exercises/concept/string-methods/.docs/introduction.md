## string-methods

Python provides a number of useful methods that you can use to manipulate
`strings`. These methods can be used for cleaning, splitting, translating,
or otherwise working with the str type. New strings can be created based
on method arguments, and/or additional information can be returned. Strings
can be concatenated using the `+` operator or with `str.join()`. Strings
also implement all of the common sequence operations along with iteration using
the `for item in <string>` syntax.

`Strings` are immutable (meaning the value does not change), so each of these
methods will actually return a new instance of `str` instead of modifying
the existing one.
