In Python, a [tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple) is an immutable collection of items in _sequence_. Like most collections, tuples can hold any (or multiple) data type(s) -- including other tuples. Like any sequence, items are referenced by 0-based index number. Tuples support all [common sequence operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#common-sequence-operations).
