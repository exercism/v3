In Python, a [list][list] is a mutable collection of items in _sequence_. Like most collections (_see the built-ins [`tuple`][tuple], [`dict`][dict] and [`set`][set]_), lists can hold reference to any (or multiple) data type(s) - including other lists. Like any [sequence][sequence type], items are referenced by 0-based index number, and can be copied in whole or in part via _slice notation_. Lists support all [common sequence operations][common sequence operations], as well as [mutable sequence operations][mutable sequence operations] like `.append()` and `.reverse()`. They can be iterated over in a loop by using the `for item in` construct.

Under the hood, lists are implemented as [dynamic arrays][dynamic array] -- similar to Java's [`Arraylist`][arraylist] type. Lists are most often used to store groups of similar data (_strings, numbers, sets etc._) of unknown length (_the number of entries may arbitrarily expand or shrink_). Accessing items in a list, checking for membership via `in`, or appending items to the "right-hand" side of a list are all very efficient. Appending to the "left-hand" side or inserting into the middle of a list is much _less_ efficient because it requires shifting items to keep them in sequence.

Because lists are mutable and can contain references to arbitrary objects, they take up more memory space than a fixed-size `array.array` type of the same apparent length. Despite this, lists are an extremely flexible and useful data structure and many built-in methods and operations in Python produce lists as their output.

## Construction

A list can be declared as a _literal_ with square `[]` brackets and commas between elements:

```python
>>> no_elements = []
[]

>>> one_element = ["Guava"]
["Guava"]

>>> elements_separated_with_commas = ["Parrot", "Bird", 334782]
["Parrot", "Bird", 334782]
```

For readability, line breaks can be used when there are many elements or nested data structures within a list:

```python
>>> lots_of_entries =[
                        "Rose",
                        "Sunflower",
                        "Poppy",
                        "Pansy",
                        "Tulip",
                        "Fuchsia",
                        "Cyclamen",
                        "Lavender",
                        "Daisy",
                        "Jasmine",
                        "Hydrangea",
                        "Hyacinth",
                        "Peony",
                        "Dahlia",
                        "Dandelion",
                        "Tuberose",
                        "Ranunculus"
                      ]
['Rose', 'Sunflower', 'Poppy', 'Pansy', 'Tulip', 'Fuchsia', 'Cyclamen', 'Lavender', 'Daisy', 'Jasmine', 'Hydrangea', 'Hyacinth', 'Peony', 'Dahlia', 'Dandelion', 'Tuberose', 'Ranunculus']

>>> nested_data_structures = [
                                 {"fish": "gold", "monkey": "brown", "parrot" : "grey"},
                                 ("fish", "mammal", "bird"),
                                 ['water', 'jungle', 'sky']
                             ]
[{"fish": "gold", "monkey": "brown", "parrot" : "grey"}, ("fish", "mammal", "bird"), ['water', 'jungle', 'sky']]
```

The `list()` constructor can be used empty or with an _iterable_ as an argument. Elements in the iterable are cycled through by the constructor and added to the list in order:

```python
>>> no_elements = list()
[]

# The tuple is unpacked and each element is added.
>>> multiple_elements_tuple = list(("Parrot", "Bird", 334782))
["Parrot", "Bird", 334782]

# The set is unpacked and each element is added.
>>> multiple_elements_set = list({2, 3, 5, 7, 11})
[2,3,5,7,11]
```

Results when using a list constructor with a string or a dict may be surprising:

````python

# String elements (Unicode code points) are iterated through and added *individually*.
>>> multiple_elements_string = list("Timbuktu")
['T', 'i', 'm', 'b', 'u', 'k', 't', 'u']


>>> multiple_code_points_string = list('अभ्यास')
['अ', 'भ', '्', 'य', 'ा', 'स']

"""
The iteration default for dictionaries is over the keys.
"""
source_data = {"fish": "gold", "monkey": "brown"}
>>> multiple_elements_dict_1 = list(source_data)
['fish', 'monkey']

Because the constructor will only take _iterables_ (or nothing) as arguments, objects that are _not_ iterable will throw a type error. Consequently, it is much easier to create a one-item list via the literal method.

```python

>>> one_element = list(16)
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
   TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable

>>> one_element_from_iterable = list((16,))
[16]
````

## Accessing elements

Items inside lists (_like the sequence types `string` and `tuple`_), can be accessed via 0-based index and _bracket notation_. Indexes can be from **`left`** --> **`right`** (_starting at zero_) or **`right`** --> **`left`** (_starting at -1_).

| **0** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** |\
 -------------------------\
 | P | y | t | h | o | n |\
 -------------------------\
 |_**-6**_ |_**-5**_ |_**-4**_ |_**-3**_ |_**-2**_ |_**-1**_ | <----

```python

>>> breakfast_foods = ["Oatmeal", "Fruit Salad", "Eggs", "Toast"]

# Oatmeal is at index 0 or index -4.
>>> first_breakfast_food = breakfast_foods[0]
'Oatmeal'

>>> first_breakfast_food = breakfast_foods[-4]
'Oatmeal'
```

You can access a portion of a list with _slice notation_ (`[start:stop]`). A _slice_  is defined as the sequence of items in a list at position `index` such that `start <=  index < stop`.  

Slicing does not modify the original `list`.  Instead, you get a new list with copies of all the elements you asked for.
You can also slice a list using a `step` parameter with the notation `[start:stop:step]`.  Using a `step` will "skip over" or filter the list elements (_for example, a `step` of 2 will be every other element in the range_).

```python

>>> colors = ["Red", "Purple", "Green", "Yellow", "Orange", "Pink", "Blue", "Grey"]

>>> middle_colors = colors[2:6]
["Green", "Yellow", "Orange", "Pink"]

# If the stop parameter is omitted, the slice will stop at the end of the list.
>>> primary_colors = colors[0::3]
["Red", "Yellow", "Blue"]
```

The method `.pop()` can be used to both remove and return a value at a given index:

```python

>>> breakfast_foods = ["Oatmeal", "Fruit Salad", "Eggs", "Toast"]

# Fruit Salad is at index 1 or index -3.
>>> breakfast_foods = ["Oatmeal", "Fruit Salad", "Eggs", "Toast"]
>>> fruit_on_the_side = breakfast_foods.pop(-3)
'Fruit Salad'

>>> print(breakfast_foods)
['Oatmeal', 'Eggs', 'Toast']

```

The method `.insert()` can be used to add an element at a specific position. The index given is the element _*before which to insert*_. `list.insert(0,element)` will insert at the front of the list and `list.insert(len(list), element)` is the equivalent of calling `list.append(element)`.

```python

breakfast_foods = ["Oatmeal", "Fruit Salad", "Eggs", "Toast"]

# Adding bacon to the mix before index 3 or index -1.
>>> breakfast_foods.insert(3,"Bacon")
>>> print(breakfast_foods)
['Oatmeal', 'Fruit Salad', 'Eggs', 'Bacon', 'Toast']


# Adding coffee in the first position.
>>> breakfast_foods.insert(0, "Coffee")
>>> print(breakfast_foods)
['Coffee', 'Oatmeal', 'Fruit Salad', 'Eggs', 'Bacon', 'Toast']
```

## Working with lists

Lists supply an _iterator_, and can be looped through/over in the same manner as other _sequence types_:

```python

>>> colors = ["Orange", "Green", "Grey", "Blue"]
>>> for item in colors:
...     print(item)
...
Orange
Green
Grey
Blue

>>> numbers_to_cube = [5, 13, 12, 16]
>>> for number in numbers_to_cube:
...     print(number*3)
...
15
39
36
48

```

One common way to compose a list of values is to use `list.append()` with a loop:

```python

>>> cubes_to_1000 = []

>>> for number in range(11):
...    cubes_to_1000.append(number**3)

>>> print(cubles_to_1000)
[0, 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000]
```

Lists can be combined via various techniques:

```python
# Using the plus + operator unpacks each list and creates a new list, but it is not efficent.
>>> new_via_concatenate = ["George", 5] + ["cat", "Tabby"]
["George", 5, "cat", "Tabby"]


# Likewise, using the multiplication operator * is the equivalent of using + n times.
>>> first_group = ["cat", "dog", "elephant"]

>>> multiplied_group = first_group * 3
['cat', 'dog', 'elephant', 'cat', 'dog', 'elephant', 'cat', 'dog', 'elephant']


# A more efficent method of combining 2 lists is to use slice asignment or appending in a loop
# by mutating one of the original lists.
first_one = ["cat", "Tabby"]
second_one = ["George", 5]

# This assigns the second list to index 0 in the first list.
>>> first_one[0:0] = second_one
>>> first_one
["George", 5, "cat", "Tabby"]

# This loops through the first list and appends it's items to the end of the second list.
>>> for item in first_one:
>>>      second_one.append(item)
...
>>> print(second_one)
["George", 5, "cat", "Tabby"]
```

## Related data types

Lists are often used as _stacks_ and _queues_ -- although their underlying implementation makes prepending and inserting slow. The [collections][collections] module offers a [deque][deque] variant optimized for fast appends and pops from either end that is implemented as a [doubly linked list][doubly linked list]. Nested lists are also used to model small _matrices_ -- although the [Numpy][numpy] and [Pandas][pandas] libraries are much more robust for efficient matrix and tabular data manipulation. The collections module also provides a `UserList` type that can be customized to fit specialized list needs.
