# Bitwise operators

TODO: ADD MORE

- this exercise relies on bitwise AND (`&`) and potentially bitwise LSHIFT (`<<`) to inspect the Boolean value of individual bits in a bitflag [allergies](../exercise-concepts/allergies.md)
- bitwise operators such as `<<`, `>>`, `&`, `|`, `~`, `^` are central to this exercise [variable-length-quantity](../exercise-concepts/variable-length-quantity.md)
