# Dictionary

TODO: ADD MORE

- Mapping type. The example solution employes a dictionary to return values from the `parse_line()` function. [origin](./exercise-concepts/markdown.md)
- mapping type that has key-value pairs. Returned by `str.maketrans` in the example code. Also one of the argument types accepted by `str.maketrans()`. [origin](./exercise-concepts/rna-transcription.md)
- the example uses a dictionary to map passed in move arguments to methods that perform the moves. The example also uses a dictionary/mapping created by calling `str.maketrans()`. [origin](./exercise-concepts/robot-simulator.md)
