# Type hinting

TODO: ADD MORE

- In modern Python it's possibly to type hint annotations to parameters and variables, see [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#module-typing). While not neccessary in Python such annotations can help your code be easier to read, understand, and check automatically using tools like `mypy`. [origin](./exercise-concepts/reverse-string.md)
