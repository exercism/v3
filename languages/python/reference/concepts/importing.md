# Importing

TODO: ADD MORE

- to use the module, the `import` syntax can be used [phone-number](../exercise-concepts/phone-number.md)
- Both the original code to be refactored for the exercise and the example solution use the `import` keyword to import the `re` module in support of Regular Expressions in python. [markdown](../exercise-concepts/markdown.md)
- a reasonably readable solution will require importing from the standard library [allergies](../exercise-concepts/allergies.md)
