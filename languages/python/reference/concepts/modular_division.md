# Modular division

TODO: ADD MORE

- the exercise relies on the `%` operator to check if one number is evenly divisible by another [leap](../exercise-concepts/leap.md)
- the example uses the modulus operator to calculate the appropriate _compass_ setting when calling the `right` compass method [robot-simulator](../exercise-concepts/robot-simulator.md)
