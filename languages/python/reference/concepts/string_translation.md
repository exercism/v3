# String translation

TODO: ADD MORE

- the `str.translate()` _instance method_ is called on an object from the `str` class (e.g. `<my string>`.translate()). Returns a copy of the inital string with each character re-mapped through the given _translation table_. The _translation table_ is typically a mapping or sequence type that implements indexing via the magic method `__getitem__()`. [rna-transcription](../exercise-concepts/rna-transcription.md)
