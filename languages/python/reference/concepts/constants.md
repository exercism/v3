# Constants

TODO: ADD MORE

- Avoid "magic numbers", defining instead meaningfully named constants. PEP 8 convention for constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` [origin](./exercise-concepts/clock.md)
- are not enforced by the runtime, but are used via the convention of `UPPER_CASE` to signal that these values are expected to remain unchanged. Preferably, constants are defined at a module level. The example solution uses the `UPPER_CASE` convention to define NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, and WEST constants. [origin](./exercise-concepts/robot-simulator.md)
