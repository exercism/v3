# Duck typing

TODO: ADD MORE

- Python is also a good example of "Duck typing," to wit, "if it walks like a duck, talks like a duck, it's a duck.". This is accomplished partly with "magic" or "dunder" methods (double-under) that provide various interfaces to an object. If an object implements `__iter__` and `__next__`, it can be iterated through; it doesn't matter what type the object actually is. [origin](./exercise-concepts/hamming.md)
- the exercise supports any argument that supports modular division and comparison to integers (ie int, float, Decimal) [origin](./exercise-concepts/leap.md)
