# Arguments & parameters

TODO: ADD MORE

- Parameters passed into a function. In python, these are noted in the `()` following a function name. The example code uses a function named `to_rna()` with an argument of `dna_strand`. [origin](./exercise-concepts/rna-transcription.md)
- The example solutions use functions that take function arguments to operate on passed in markdown strings. [origin](./exercise-concepts/markdown.md)
- the exercise requires a single positional parameter in the function signature [origin](./exercise-concepts/leap.md)
- concept over arguments of a function and how to use them is required [origin](./exercise-concepts/variable-length-quantity.md)
- the methods returning "row" and "column" need to take both `self` and an integer as arguments [origin](./exercise-concepts/matrix.md)
- the example `__init__` method has `self`, direction, x, and y (coordinates) as parameters. It also uses `self` and `commands` (a string) for parameters of the `move()` method. [origin](./exercise-concepts/robot-simulator.md)
