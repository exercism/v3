# `bytearray`

TODO: ADD MORE DETAIL

See the Python documentation entries for the [binary sequence types][docs-binary-sequence-types], of which [`bytearray`][docs-bytearray-type] is the [mutable][mutation] member. You'll also want to familiarize yourself with the use of [`bytearray` as a casting function][docs-bytearray-as-function], as well as the many [common binary sequence methods][docs-binary-sequence-methods] and [mutable sequence methods][docs-mutable-sequence-methods] available to use on the type.
