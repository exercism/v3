# `list`

TODO: ADD MORE DETAIL

See the Python documentation entries for the [mutable][mutation] [`list` type][docs-list-type] and it's [constructor][list-as-function]. This is Python's most commonly used [sequential collection][docs-sequence-types], and as it allows _homogenous data_ it's quite different from the [fixed array][general-concept-array] and [singly-linked list][general-concept-list] types you may have encountered in other, less flexible, languages.
