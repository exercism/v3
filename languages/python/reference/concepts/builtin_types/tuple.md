# `tuple`

TODO: ADD MORE DETAIL

See the Python documentation entries for the [immutable][immutability] [`tuple` type][docs-tuple-type] and its [constructor][tuple-as-function]. One of Python's [sequential collection types][docs-sequence-types], it is fixed in size, but allows _homogenous data_. Because it cannot be resized it is less flexible than a [`list`][list], but has the advantage of taking up very little room in memory, compared to any other collection.
