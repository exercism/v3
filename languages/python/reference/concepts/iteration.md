# Iteration

TODO: ADD MORE

- the passed-in string is iterated over, and split into rows. The row lists are iterated over and split into elements [matrix](../exercise-concepts/matrix.md)
- the example uses a `for loop` to iterate through the letters of the passed-in `commands` string and looks up the corresponding values in a dictionary, so that the appropriate methods can be called to move the `robot`. [robot-simulator](../exercise-concepts/robot-simulator.md)
- the `for ... in` concept is useful to loop over the lists [variable-length-quantity](../exercise-concepts/variable-length-quantity.md)
