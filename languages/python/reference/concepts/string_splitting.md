# String splitting

TODO: ADD MORE

- The example solution uses `str.split()` to break the passed in markdown string into a list of lines broken up by the `\n` character. The alternate Python example solution uses `str.splitlines()` for the same effect across all line end characters. [markdown](../exercise-concepts/markdown.md)
- the example uses `str.split` with and without seperators to break the passed in string into "rows" and then "elements" [matrix](../exercise-concepts/matrix.md)
