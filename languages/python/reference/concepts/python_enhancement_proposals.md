# Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)

Python is an incredibly popular language with a _great_ many users across an impressive number of domains; as such evolving the language is a complex undertaking that can't be rushed. The Python Enhancement Proposal (commonly known as PEP) process exists to provide a formal mechanism by which the community can propose, debate, vote on, and ultimately adopt significant changes to the language itself.

Even if you doubt you'll ever submit a PEP it's a good idea to keep abreast of what PEPs are out there and what changes are coming to a Python near you.

Two PEPs in particular will serve as a useful jumping off point:

- [PEP 0](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) lists all current and historic PEPs.
- [PEP 1](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/) explains the PEP process.
