# Boolean operators

TODO: ADD MORE

- the exercise relies on `and`, `or`, and (optionally) `not` to form Boolean predicates [origin](./exercise-concepts/leap.md)
- the exercise relies on `and` and `or` to combine Boolean predicates into a single logical answer [origin](./exercise-concepts/leap.md)
- the `or` and `and` keywords are used [origin](./exercise-concepts/phone-number.md)
