# Exiting Loops

Sometimes you need to abort or otherwise modify a loop (both `while` or `for` loops). You may want your program to exit it completely or skip part of it before continuing with the next iterations. You can do these actions with [break](keyword-break) and [continue](keyword-continue) python's keywords.
