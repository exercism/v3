# Exiting Loops

Sometimes you need to abort or otherwise modify a loop (both `while` or `for` loops). You may want your program to exit it completely or skip part of it before continuing with the next iterations. You can do these actions with [break](./keywords/break.md) and [continue](./keywords/continue.md) python's keywords.

See [this blog post][exiting-loop-ref] for more details.
