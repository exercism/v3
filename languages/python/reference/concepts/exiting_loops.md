# `Exiting Loops`

Sometimes you need to abort or otherwise modify a loop (both `while` or `for`). You may want your program to exit a loop completely or skip part of a loop before continuing with the next iteration. You can do these actions with [break](keyword-break) and [continue](keyword-continue).
