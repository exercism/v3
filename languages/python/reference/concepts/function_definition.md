# Function definition

TODO: ADD MORE

- functions are defined and named using the `def` keyword [hamming](../exercise-concepts/hamming.md)
- A named (_and often reusable_) section of code that performs a specific task. It may or may not have _arguments_ passed in, and may or may not _return_ data. Created using the `def` keyword. [rna-transcription](../exercise-concepts/rna-transcription.md)
- Tests for this exercise expect a function named `parse` that can be called to transform the _markdown_ formatted text and return HTML formatted text. [markdown](../exercise-concepts/markdown.md)
