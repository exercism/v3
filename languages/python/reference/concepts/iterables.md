# Iterable

TODO: ADD MORE

- strings are iterable, which provides a lot of opportunity to leverage Python functions against them [hamming](../exercise-concepts/hamming.md)
- understanding that strings, lists, and other data structures can be iterated over in the same fashion [matrix](../exercise-concepts/matrix.md)
- characters in a string are _iterables_ and are subject to index and slice access as described below [phone-number](../exercise-concepts/phone-number.md)
- The example solution uses the `for _ in _` syntax to iterate over a list of lines. This is possible because a list is an `iterable`. [markdown](../exercise-concepts/markdown.md)
