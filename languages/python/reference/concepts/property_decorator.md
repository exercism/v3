# Property decorator

TODO: ADD MORE

- the `property()` built-in is a function that returns a property attribute. When used as a decorator, this transforms the passed-in method into a _getter_ method for read-only attribute with the same name and docstring. [robot-simulator](../exercise-concepts/robot-simulator.md)
- this exercise relies on the `@property` decorator to provide read-only dynamic access to the current list of allergens [allergies](../exercise-concepts/allergies.md)
