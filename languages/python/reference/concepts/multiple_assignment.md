# Multiple assignment

TODO: ADD MORE

- Python allows multiple assignment, assigning the items on the left of `=` _in order_ to the values on the right of `=` by forming tuples and then "unpacking" them. This exercise solution uses multiple assignment for the constant values NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST. [origin](./exercise-concepts/robot-simulator.md)
