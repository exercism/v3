TODO: ADD MORE

- The example solution uses assignment for variables and other values. [markdown](../exercise-concepts/markdown.md)
- instance properties need to be assigned passed in data [matrix](../exercise-concepts/matrix.md)
- the example uses assignment for all the instance properties and `instructions` dictionary. [robot-simulator](../exercise-concepts/robot-simulator.md)
