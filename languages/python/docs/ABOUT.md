Python is a strong language for beginners.

There are many resources available for programmers of all levels, the code is highly readable, and in many cases phrases are comparable to those in the English language.

Code can be written and executed from the command line, in an interactive IPython session, or in a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) (IPython) notebook.

The most common form of Python is compiled in C; this is often invisible to the beginning programmer, but if there are uses for which exceptionally fast implementation is needed then C extensions can be written to optimize Python execution.

[Python is used extensively](https://www.python.org/about/apps/) in scientific computing, finance, games, networking, internet development, and in assembling pipelines of other programs.

Python was started by Guido van Rossum in 1989; its name is an homage to the comedy troupe Monty Python.

This track uses Python 3. It is highly recommended that students upgrade to at least Python 3.6 as some features used by this track may not be supported in earlier version of Python.

Python development is shepherded by [The Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/about/) and there are active community-based user groups worldwide.
