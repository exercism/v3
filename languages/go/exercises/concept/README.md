# Go concept exercises

The concept exercises are based on this [list of concepts][docs-concept-exercises].

## Implemented exercises

These are the concept exercises that have currently been implemented, as well as the concepts they teach and their prerequisite concepts:

| exercise                                              | concepts                     | prerequisites                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------  | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| [`basics`][concept-exercise-basics]                   | `basics`                     |                                     |
| [`conditionals`][concept-exercise-conditionals]       | `conditionals-if`<br/>`conditionals-switch`<br/>`booleans` | `numbers`<br/>`basic-strings`|
| [`erros`][concept-exercise-erros]     | `erros`<br/>`basics`         | `constants`<br/>`types`                     |
| [`maps`][concept-exercise-maps]       | `maps`                       | `numbers`<br/>`conditionals`<br/>`functions`|
| [`numbers`][concept-exercise-numbers] | `numbers`<br/>`conditionals` | `basics`                                    |
| [`slices`][concept-exercise-slices]   | `slices`                     | `arrays`<br/>`numbers`                      |
| [`strings`][concept-exercise-strings] | `strings`                    | `basics`                                    |



**⚠ Note ⚠**: The idea here is to use a `concept` name for the exercise/folder, but perhaps use some sort of "progression", so they will naturally become a sort of path to traverse.

It's only important that it's reasonably easy to _find_ the exercise. It's okay if the name isn't perfect. We **will** iterate on this.
