In this exercise, your task is to help a weather station manage their weather forecasting program.

## 1. Document package weather

Write a package comment for `package weather` that describes its contents.

## 2. Document the CurrentCondition variable

Write a comment for the package variable `CurrentCondition`.

Remember, comments for package variables should describe their _content_, not their _purpose_.

## 3. Document the CurrentLocation variable

Just like the previous step, write a comment for `CurrentLocation`.

## 4. Document the Log() function

Write a function comment for `Log()`.
