In this exercise, your task is to help a weather station manage their weather forecasting program.

## 1. Write a package comment 

Complete the package comment for `package weather` that describes its content. 

## 2. Define a variable for the current weather condition

Write a function comment and define the package variable `CurrentCondition()`. Explicitly specify its type as a string. 

Remember, comments for package variables should describe _what_ they do, not _why_. 

## 3. Define the InputCurrentWeather() function

Write a function comment and define the function `InputCurrentWeather()` that takes a string called `weather`. This function should update `CurrentCondition()` by assigning `weather` to it. This function does not have a return value.

## 4. Define the Log() function

Write a function comment a define function `Log()`, which should return a `string`. The weather station would like this function to return a short statement that presents the `CurrentCondition`.
