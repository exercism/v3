In the previous exercise, we saw that there are two ways to write comments in Go: single line comments that are preceded by `//`, and multiline comment blocks that are wrapped with `/*` and `*/`.

## Comments for documentation

In Go, comments play an important role in documenting code. They are used by the tool [godoc][godoc], which extracts these comments to create documentation about Go packages. A documentation comment should be a complete sentence that starts with the name of the thing being described and ends with a period.

For comments other than documentation comments, while they may be helpful for maintainers, a [good rule of thumb][less comments] and more sustainable solution is to write code that is easier to understand so that explanatory comments are hopefully not needed.

## Comments for exported identifiers

Documentation comments should precede packages as well as [exported identifier][exported identifiers]s, e.g. exported functions, methods, package variables, constants, and structs, which you will learn more about in the next exercises. Comments written for packages and exported identifiers are useful for the users who import and use these packages.

Note, however, that identifiers (such as variables) that are declared inside of functions and methods are private and do not necessarily require comments for the users of the packages.

A package variable can look like this:

```go
// TemperatureFahrenheit gives a certain
// temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.
var TemperatureFahrenheit int
```

Note that `TemperatureFahrenheit` is capitalized, which makes this exported identifier a global variable.

## Package comments

Package comments should be written directly before a package and begin with `Pacakge X ...` like this:

```go
// Package kelvin provides tools to convert
// temperatures to and from Kelvin.
package kelvin
```

## Function comments

A function comment can look like this:

```go
// CelsiusFreezingTemp returns the temp
// at which water freezes in degrees Celsius.
func CelsiusFreezingTemp() int {
	return 0
}
```

## Golint

[Golint][golint] is a great tool to check for missing comments and other common stylistic issues, which you can read more about at [Effective Go][effective go].

You can install `golint` on your machine with the following command:

```
go get -u golang.org/x/lint/golint
```

It's a good idea to configure your editor to run `golint` for you, otherwise you can invoke it like this:

```
golint weather.go
```

To use `golint` command globally, make sure that it is in your `$PATH`.
