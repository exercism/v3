## General

A `structs` is a sequence of named elements, called fields, each one having a name and a type.

### 1. Creating a new remote controlled car

- Define a new [struct][struct] with 3 fields
- Create a function that returns the type of the new created struct and updates the fields accordingly

### 2. Creating a race track

- Define a new [struct][struct] with 1 field
- Create a function that returns the type of the new created struct and updates the fields accordingly

### 3. Drive the car

- Add a new field to keep track of the distance drive
- You need to check if there is enough battery to drive the car

### 4. Check if a remote controlled car can finish a race

- You need to calculate the maximum distance a car can drive
- We assume that the car has initially the battery 100% charged
