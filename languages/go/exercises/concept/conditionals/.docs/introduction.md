# Introduction

Conditionals in Go are similar to conditionals in other languages. The underlying type of any conditional operation is the `bool` type, which can have the value of `true` or `false`. Conditionals are often used as flow control mechanisms to check for various conditions. For checking a particular case an `if` statement can be used, which executes its code if the underlying condition is `true` like this: 

```go
if condition {

}
```

In scenarios involving more than one case many `if` statements can be chained together using the `else if` and `else` statements. Go also provides a `switch` statement for more advanced scenarios.
