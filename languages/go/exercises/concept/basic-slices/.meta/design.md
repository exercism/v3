## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics on how to work with slices in Go.

## Things to teach

For example:

- instantiate (len, cap)
- append
- set value
- read value
- remove value
- taking length
- subslices
- expanding slices (e.g. in `append(slice1, slice2...)`)

## Things not to teach

For example:

- inner workings of slices
- arrays

## Concepts

- `basic-slices`

## Prerequisites

- iteration (which in turn depends on `numbers`, `functions`, `conditionals`)

Not yet available: `range iteration`
