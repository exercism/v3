# General

- The `fmt` package of the standard library has some [formatting functionality for strings][fmt-package].

- To add one string to another, you can use the `"+"` operator.

```go
s := "Hello"
s += " word."
fmt.Println(s)
// Output: Hello world.
```

- This [Go 101][go101], will offer you more details about this concept.
