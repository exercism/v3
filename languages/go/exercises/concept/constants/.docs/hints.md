## General

- [Constants][const]

## 1. Represent the fixed interest rate on a loan

- The constant should be untyped, but needs to be acceptable anywhere a float can be used.

## 2. Represent the number of days in a year

- The constant should be given an explicit type used for whole numbers.

## 3. Represent the months of the year

- There is an [identifier][iota] for creating enumerated constants.
