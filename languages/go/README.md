## Object-oriented Concepts

> Although Go has types and methods and allows an object-oriented style of programming, there is no type hierarchy. The concept of "interface" in Go provides a different approach that we believe is easy to use and in some ways more general. There are also ways to embed types in other types to provide something analogous-but not identical-to subclassing. Moreover, methods in Go are more general than in C++ or Java: they can be defined for any sort of data, even built-in types such as plain, "unboxed" integers. They are not restricted to structs (classes). [Is Go an object-oriented language?](https://golang.org/doc/faq#Is_Go_an_object-oriented_language)

- Structs (Classes)
- Method Sets
- Encapsulation
- State
- Mutation
- Composition
- Polymorphism (?)
- Interfaces

## Functional Concepts

> Go is not a functional language but has a lot of features that enable us to apply functional principles. [Functional Go](https://medium.com/@geisonfgfg/functional-go-bc116f4c96a4)

- Anonymous Functions
- Function Composition
- Higher Order Functions
- Multiple Return Values
- Named Returns
- Nested Functions
- Partial Application
- Pipelines (?)
- Pure Functions (?)
- Recursion
- REPL (some community projects)
- Type Inference

## Types

- array (rarely used)
- bool
- channel
- function
- interface
- interface{} (empty interface)
- map
- nil
- Numeric Types (`uint` types, `int` types, `float` types, `complex` types, `byte` and `rune`)
- pointer
- slice
- string
- struct
