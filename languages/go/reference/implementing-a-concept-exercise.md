# How to implement a Go concept exercise

This document describes how to implement a concept exercise for the Go track. As this document is exercise generic, the following placeholders are used:

- `<SLUG>`: the name of the exercise in kebab-case (e.g. `basic-strings`).
- `<NAME>`: the name of the exercise in snake_case (e.g. `basic_strings`).

Before implementing the exercise, please make sure you have a good understanding of what the exercise should be teaching (and what not). This information can be found in the exercise's GitHub issue. Having done this, please read the [Go concept exercises introduction][concept-exercises].

To implement a concept exercise, the following files must be created:

<pre>
languages
└── go
    └── exercises
        └── concept
            └── &lt;SLUG&gt;
                ├── .docs
                |   ├── instructions.md
                |   ├── introduction.md
                |   ├── hints.md
                |   └── after.md (optional)
                ├── .meta
                |   |── config.json
                |   |── design.md
                |   └── example.go
                ├── &lt;NAME&gt;.go
                └── &lt;NAME&gt;_test.go
</pre>

## Step 1: adding track-specific files

These files are specific to the Go track:

- `<NAME>.go`. the stub implementation file, which is the starting point for students to work on the exercise.
- `<NAME>_test.go`: the test suite.
- `.meta/example.go`: an example implementation that passes all the tests.

## Step 2: adding common files

How to create the files common to all tracks is described in the [how to implement a concept exercise document][how-to-implement-a-concept-exercise].

## Step 3: add analyzer (optional)

Some exercises could benefit from having an exercise-specific [analyzer][analyzer]. If so, specify what analysis rules should be applied to this exercise and why.

## Step 4: custom representation (optional)

Some exercises could benefit from having a custom representation as generated by the [Go representer][representer]. If so, specify what changes to the representation should be applied and why.

## Inspiration

When implementing an exercise, it can be very useful to look at already implemented Go exercises like the [strings][concept-exercise-basic-strings] or [numbers][concept-exercise-numbers] exercises. You can also check the exercise's [general concepts documents][reference] to see if other languages have already implemented an exercise for that concept.

## Style Guide

To keep things roughly in sync on styling, here a little [style guide][style guide].

## Help

If you have any questions regarding implementing the exercise, please post them as comments in the exercise's GitHub issue.
