# Learning Dart with a Ruby background

Talk about argument requirements, difference of object is everything (ruby) and existence of meta singleton/eigenclass (ruby) vs object is everything (dart) -> but not really and inheritance change.

Other concepts to mention:

- Mixin comparison
- explicit export (vs implicit export in Ruby)
- explicit import (vs "global" import in Ruby)
- .with_index vs second argument on comprehensions
- gems vs packages
