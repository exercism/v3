Strings are useful for holding data that can be represented in text form. Some
of the most-used operations on strings are to check their `length`, to build
and concatenate them using the `+` and `+=` string operators, checking for the
existence or location of substrings with the `indexOf()` method, or extracting
substrings with the `substring()` method.
