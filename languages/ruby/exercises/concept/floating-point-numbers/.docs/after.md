You can find a short introduction to floating-point numbers at [0.30000000000000004.com][0.30000000000000004.com].

The [Float Toy page][evanw.github.io-float-toy] has a nice, graphical explanation how a floating-point numbers' bits are converted to an actual floating-point value.

To repeatedly execute logic, one can use loops. In this example the `while` loop is useful because it keeps on looping until a boolean condition evaluates to `true`.
