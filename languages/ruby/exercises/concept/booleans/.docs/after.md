## True, False

- `true` and `false` are used to represent boolean logical states.
  - They are singleton instances of the [`TrueClass`][true-class] and [`FalseClass`][false-class] objects.
  - they may occur as literals in code, or as the result of logical (`&&`, `||`, `!`) or [comparison][comparable-class] (`<`, `>`, `==`) methods.

## _Truthy_ and _falsey_

- When not using explicit boolean values, _truthy_ and _falsey_ evaluation rules are applied:

  - Only `false` and `nil` evaluate to _falsey_.
  - Everything else, objects and values, evaluate to _truthy_.

  ```ruby
  # A simplified definition
  def falsey
    nil || false
  end

  def truthy
    not falsey
  end
  ```

- It is common to use _truthy_ and _falsey_ values to determine the outcome of [control expressions][control-expressions].

  - `if`...`else` exists as a construct, similar to the [_C-family_ of programming languages][c-family]
  - it is often more idiomatic to use `if` and `unless` as [expression modifiers to "guard" an expression][if-modifier]

  ```ruby
  1 + 1 if truthy
  # => this will evaluate and return 2

  2 + 2 if falsey
  # => the numbers are not added because of the modifier, nil is returned

  3 + 3 unless truthy
  # => the numbers are not added because of the modifier, nil is returned

  4 + 4 unless falsey
  # => this will evaluate and return 8
  ```
