# Ruby concept exercises

The concept exercises are based on this [list of concepts][reference-shared].

## Implemented exercises

These are the concept exercises that have currently been implemented, as well as the concepts they teach and their prerequisite concepts:

| exercise                                                            | concepts                             | prerequisites                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| [`strings`][concept-exercise-strings]                               | `strings-basic`                      | -                            |
| [`basics`][concept-exercise-basics]                                 | `basics`                             | -                            |  |
| [`floating-point-numbers`][concept-exercise-floating-point-numbers] | `floating-point-numbers`<br/>`loops` | `numbers`<br/>`conditionals` |

**⚠ Note ⚠**: The idea here is to use a `concept` name for the exercise/folder, but perhaps use some sort of "progression", so they will naturally become a sort of path to traverse.

It's only important that it's reasonably easy to _find_ the exercise. It's okay if the name isn't perfect. We **will** iterate on this.

## TODO
