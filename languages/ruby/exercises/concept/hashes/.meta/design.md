# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of the Concept of hashes through [Ruby][ruby-doc-hash].

## Learning objectives

After completing this exercise, the student should:

- Know of the existence of the `Hash` collection.
- Know how to create and initialise a `Hash`.
- Know how to assign values to existing `Hash` keys.
- Know how to add new `Hash` key.
- Know how to iterate over a `Hash`.

## Out of scope

- Enumerable methods like select, reject, compact, etc.
- Memory and performance characteristics.

## Concepts

- `Hash`: know of the existence of the `Hash` collection; know how to create and initialise a `Hash`; know how to assign values to existing `Hash` keys; know how to add new `Hash` key; know how to iterate over a `Hash`.

## Prequisites

This exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `strings`: log lines are `String` values.

## Representer

This exercise does not require any specific representation logic to be added to the [representer][representer].

## Analyzer

This exercise does not require any specific logic to be added to the [analyzer][analyzer].
