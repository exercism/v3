# Debug

When a test fails or your code doesn't compile there will be an error shown in the console. If it's not helpful you can run the [`stack ghci` command][docs-stack-ghci] and enter the [interactive REPL][docs-ghci]. There you can try out your functions and experiment until you understand how to correct your code.
