# CLI

You can run the tests by opening a command prompt in the exercise's directory, and then running the [`stack test` command][docs-stack-test]. If your code compiles, this command will show you which tests passed and which failed - when a test fails try to make it pass and execute tests again.

Once all the tests are passing, you can submit your solution by opening a command prompt in the exercise's directory and running the [`exercism submit` command][docs-exercism-cli].
