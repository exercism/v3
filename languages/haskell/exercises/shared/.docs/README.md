# Haskell shared exercise documents

There are two documents that are shared between all exercises:

- [cli.md][cli]: contains information on how to work with the exercise when using the CLI to download and submit the exercise.
- [debug.md][debug]: explains how a student that is coding in the browser can still do "debugging."

[cli]: ./cli.md
[debug]: ./debug.md
