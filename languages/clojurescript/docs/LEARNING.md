Exercism provides exercises and feedback but can be difficult to jump into for those learning Clojurescript for the first time.
Clojurescript is a dialect of Clojure. Syntax and the Core functions are almost equal. But, Clojurescript differs from Clojure in deeps in a meaningful way because of the hosted platform.
Understanding on Clojure, as a language is recommended Because of that, you will find some Clojure resources in this very document.
