In this exercise you will implement a partial set of utility routines to help a developer
clean up identifier names.

In the 4 tasks you will gradually build up the routine `clean`. A valid identifier comprises
zero or more letters and underscores.

In all cases the input string is guaranteed to be non-nil. If an empty string is passed to the `clean` function, an empty string should be returned.

Note that the caller should avoid calling the routine `clean` with an empty identifier since such identifiers are ineffectual.

### 1. Replace any spaces encountered with underscores

Implement the `clean` function to replace any spaces with underscores. This also applies to leading and trailing spaces.

```clojure
(clean "my   Id")
;;=> "my___Id"
```

### 2. Replace control characters with the upper case string "CTRL"

Modify the `clean` function to replace control characters with the upper case string `"CTRL"`.

```clojure
(clean "my\0Id")
;;=> "myCTRLId"
```

### 3. Convert kebab-case to camelCase

Modify the `clean` function to convert kebab-case to camelCase.

```clojure
(clean "à-ḃç")
;;=> "àḂç"
```

### 4. Omit Greek lower case letters

Modify the `clean` function to omit any Greek letters in the range 'α' to 'ω'.

```clojure
(clean "MyΟβιεγτFinder")
;;=> "MyΟFinder"
```
