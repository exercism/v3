## 1. Define the expected oven time in minutes

- You need to define a [var][vars] using [def].

## 2. Calculate the remaining oven time in minutes

- You need to define a [function][functions] with a single parameter.
- You can use and refer to the previously defined var by its name.
- The result of evaluating the last expression in a function is automatically returned from the function; all functions return this value.
- You can use the core functions for [operations on numbers][operators] to subtract values.

## 3. Calculate the preparation time in minutes

- You need to define a [function][functions] with a single parameter.
- You can use the core functions for [operations on numbers][operators] to multiply values.

## 4. Calculate the elapsed time in minutes

- You need to define a [function][functions] with two parameters.
- You can [call][calling] one of the other functions you've defined previously.
- You can use the core functions for [operations on numbers][operators] to add values.
