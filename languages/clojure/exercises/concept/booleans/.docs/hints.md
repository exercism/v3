## 1. Check if a fast attack can be made

We need to check if the knight is awake and *invert* its truth value. This can be done with the [`not`][not] function.

## 2. Check if the group can be spied upon

We want the function to return `true` if *any* of the supplied predicates are true. This can be done using the [`or`][or] function.

## 3. Check if the prisoner can be signalled

We want to return `true` if and only if *all* of the supplied predicates are truthy. This can be done with the [`and`][and] function.

## 4. Check if the prisoner can be freed

Here, we need to combine the three basic logical operators, [`and`][and], [`or`][or], and [`not`][not].
