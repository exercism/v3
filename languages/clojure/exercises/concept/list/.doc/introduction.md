# Introduction

`List` in Clojure is, like [that][type-list] in other languages, a [collection][type-collection] of values. It looks like quite differntly however.

A list is created with a `'` at the beginning and followed by grouping items with parentheses. Think about why a `'` is needed?

In Clojure, lists are _heterogenous_ and can contain mutliple types of item internally.
