# Instructions

In this exercise you'll be writing code to process a list of programming languages you are planning to practice from Exercism platform.

- Create
- Add
- Remove
- Query
- Count
- Sort

You have 7 tasks.

### 1. Create an empty list

Define function to return an empty list.

### 2. Add a new item to the list

Define function to add new item to the list.

### 3. Remove an item from the list

Define function to remove an item from the list

### 4. Query an item from the list

Define function to query an item from the list

### 5. Count the list

Define function to count the list

### 6. Sort a list

Define function to sort a list

### 7. Use the above functions (Optional)

Define a `learning-list` function, within which you will use the functions you've defined above:

- Create an empty list
- Add 4 new programming languages to the list

  - "Clojure"
  - "Lisp"
  - "Java"
  - "JavaScript"
  
- Remove "Lisp" from the list, as you might not have enough time for the year, and it's quite similar to Clojure.
- Check that "Lisp" is removed from the list
- Count the total number of languages
- Sort the languages list in ascending order
