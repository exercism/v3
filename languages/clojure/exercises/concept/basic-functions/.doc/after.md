## Key Learnings

- Functions are defined with the `defn` macro.
- Functions can receive one or more arguments.
- Functions have docstrings which allow you to describe the function in words. 
- Once a function is defined, it can be invoked or imported elsewhere in the code.
- The result of the last expression of a Clojure function is the value it returns.
