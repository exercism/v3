## 1. Create an empty list

Creating an empty list is just like creating a list with items. It can be done using `list` or using `quote` on an empty list.

## 2. Add a new language to the list

Clojure has a core function that can [prepend an item to a list](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/cons).

## 3. Check the language last added

Like other Lisps, Clojure has a function that [returns the first item from a list](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/first).

## 4. Remove the first language from the list

Likewise, Clojure also has a function for [returning a list with the first item removed](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/rest).

## 5. Count the languages in the list

The [number of items](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/count) in a list can easily be returned using a Clojure core function.

## 6. Put it all together

Remember that function calls can be nested.
