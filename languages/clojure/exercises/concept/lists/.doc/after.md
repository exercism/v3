## Key Learnings

- Lists are collections.
- Lists can be created using `list` or by quoting a literal list.
- Clojure will try to evaluate lists, treating the first item as a function.
- Core Functions
  - `cons` returns a list with the new item added to beginning.
  - `first` returns the first item from a list.
  - `rest` returns the list without the first item.
  - `count` returns the number of items in the list.
