# Installation

## Installing Leiningen
The simplest approach to setting up a Clojure environment is to install the build tool [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) which will provide access to a REPL (Read Eval Print Loop) for interactive development and allow you to run Clojure code.

### Linux and Windows
For installation instructions on most platforms see: [Leiningen installation](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen#installation).

### Homebrew for Mac OS X
Update your Homebrew:
``` bash
$ brew update
```

Install Leiningen:
``` bash
$ brew install leiningen
```

### Installing the standalone JAR
Alternatively you can download the latest stable release jar file from [clojure.org/downloads](http://clojure.org/community/downloads) which contains everything required to run Clojure code and provides a basic REPL.
