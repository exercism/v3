[Clojure](http://clojure.org) is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
Designed as a general purpose language, Clojure combines the approachability of a scripting language with a robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming.

Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent [data structures](http://clojure.org/data_structures).

Clojure is open source, and information about contributing to the language [can be found here](http://clojure.org/contributing).

Rich Hickey, the creator of Clojure, wanted a modern Lisp for functional programming, symbiotic with the established Java platform, and designed for concurrency; thus, Clojure was born.

Here are a couple quotes that exemplify the goals of Clojure:

* _Good design is not about making grand plans, but about taking things apart._
* _Programming is not about typing...it's about thinking._
