- See the [characteristics of the floating-point types table][docs-microsoft.com-characteristics-of-the-floating-point-types] for an overview of the precision, approximate range and size of the three floating-point types.

- Converting between numeric types is sometimes [automatic (implicit)][docs-microsoft.com-implicit-numeric-conversion], but at other times [manual (explicit)][docs-microsoft.com-explicit-numeric-conversion].

- Be careful when checking the values of floating-point types for equality, as values that can appear to represent the same value could actually be different. See [this article][docs.microsoft.com_precision-in-comparisons] for more information.

- You can find a short introduction to floating-point numbers at [0.30000000000000004.com][0.30000000000000004.com].
