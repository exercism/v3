# C&#35; concept exercises

The concept exercises are based on this [list of concepts][reference-shared].

## Implemented exercises

These are the concept exercises that have currently been implemented, as well as the concepts they teach and their prerequisite concepts:

| exercise                                                            | concepts                                                       | prerequisites                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`numbers`][concept-exercise-numbers]                               | `basic-numbers`<br/>`basic-type-conversion`<br/>`conditionals` | -                                                              |
| [`numbers-floating-point`][concept-exercise-numbers-floating-point] | `floating-point-numbers`<br/>`loops`                           | `basic-numbers`<br/>`basic-type-conversion`<br/>`conditionals` |
| [`strings`][concept-exercise-strings]                               | `basic-strings`                                                | -                                                              |
| [`enums`][concept-exercise-enums]                                   | `basic-enums`                                                  | `basic-strings`                                                |
| [`dates`][concept-exercise-dates]                                   | `basic-dates`<br/>`basic-time`<br/>`string-formatting`         | `basic-numbers`<br/>`basic-strings`                            |
| [`bitwise-operations`][concept-exercise-bitwise-operations]         | `bitwise-operations`<br/>`advanced-enums`                      | `basic-enums`                                                  |

**⚠ Note ⚠**: The idea here is to use a `concept` name for the exercise/folder, but perhaps use some sort of "progression", so they will naturally become a sort of path to traverse. In this example, the `numbers` exercise only teaches basic number usage, and the `numbers-floating-point` exercise builds on that and digs deeper into floating-point numbers.

It's only important that it's reasonably easy to _find_ the exercise. It's okay if the name isn't perfect. We **will** iterate on this.
