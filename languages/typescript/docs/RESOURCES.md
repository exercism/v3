## Editors

### Free/Open-Source

* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

  VS Code is an open-source code editor. You can find information on how to set up TypeScript [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/typescript). VS Code is a popular editor for TypeScript because Microsoft teams maintain both VS Code and TypeScript, so it works well with the language; VS Code supports TS without any extra configuration. In fact, VS Code was [written using TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/tree/master/src/vs)!

  A common issue with VS Code and TS is when your editor and project versions are different, which can cause VS Code to display a possibly confusing error message. Instructions on how to handle this error are [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/typescript#_using-newer-typescript-versions)
