# Overview

Generates the needed scaffolding for a concept exercise

## Usage

When possible, this script should be run from this directory. Otherwise you will
need to manually specify the output and template paths.

The binary can be run in the following way:

```bash
# generate-scaffolding <slug> [OPTIONAL: <output-path> <template-path>]
$ ./generate-scaffolding function-definition
Creating exercises/concept/function-definition/.meta/config.json...
Creating exercises/concept/function-definition/.meta/design.md...
Creating exercises/concept/function-definition/.meta/exemplar.lisp...
Creating exercises/concept/function-definition/.docs/after.md...
Creating exercises/concept/function-definition/.docs/hints.md...
Creating exercises/concept/function-definition/.docs/instructions.md...
Creating exercises/concept/function-definition/.docs/introduction.md...
Creating exercises/concept/function-definition/function-definition-test.lisp...
Creating exercises/concept/function-definition/function-definition.lisp...
```

If you would rather work from the REPL, you can load `generate-scaffolding.lisp`
then run:

```lisp
CL-USER> (scaffolder:make-scaffold "enumeration")
Creating exercises/concept/enumeration/.meta/config.json...
Creating exercises/concept/enumeration/.meta/design.md...
Creating exercises/concept/enumeration/.meta/exemplar.lisp...
Creating exercises/concept/enumeration/.docs/after.md...
Creating exercises/concept/enumeration/.docs/hints.md...
Creating exercises/concept/enumeration/.docs/instructions.md...
Creating exercises/concept/enumeration/.docs/introduction.md...
Creating exercises/concept/enumeration/enumeration-test.lisp...
Creating exercises/concept/enumeration/enumeration.lisp...
NIL
```

## Binary Creation

```lisp
(sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die "generate-scaffolding" :toplevel #'scaffolder::main :executable t :compression 9)
```
