# CLI

Start the REPL from the directory that you downloaded the exercise to.

You can run the tests by loading the test file into the REPL with `(load "exercise-test")` (replacing "exercise" with appropriate name). Then evaluate `(exercise-test:run-test-suite)` to run all the tests.

If you write your code directly in the REPL then simply evaluate `(exercise-test:run-test-suite)`.

If you write your code in the exercise lisp file then load it with `(load "exercise")` then evaluate `(exercise-test:run-test-suite)`.
