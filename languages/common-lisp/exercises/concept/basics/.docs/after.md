This exercise's goal was to begin learning about Common Lisp with a small
example of its most basic data structures (atoms and conses) and to get to grips
with symbols and the concept of true and false in Common Lisp

Along the way you saw examples of how to write functions as well as learned how
to load code and run it in your Common Lisp implementation.

Future exercises will dive much deeper into function definition and how quoting
can be used to manipulate code was if it were data (among many other topics).
