## Comments

As a quick side-note before jumping into things, Common Lisp, like most
programming languages, allows the programmer to write "comments" that are
ignored when your program is being run. In Common Lisp, single-line comments
begin with one or more semi-colons (`;`) and follow a couple of conventions:

```lisp
;;;; A short title for a block of code
;;; A longer description of a block of code
;; Describe the code below this line
; Describe the code before the semi-colon (;) on this line
```

Multi-line comments are possible using `#|` and `|#`:

```lisp
#|
This entire block of text is a comment
and can span several lines!

How cool is that?!
|#
```

Occasionally, you may see the following:

```lisp
(code...) ; => value
```

Where the comment is being used to indicate what value is returned by Common
Lisp after running the code on that line.

## S-Expressions

All Common Lisp code is made from S-Expressions (or sexpr for short). An
S-Expression is either an "atom" (a single, indivisible value) or a list (also
termed a "cons"). A cons is made up of two parts: the first element and the rest
of the elements. For historical reasons these two parts are called the `car` and
the `cdr`. When S-Expressions are evaluated as code, the first element (`car`)
represents the function being called while the rest of the elements (`cdr`)
represent the arguments to that function. In other words:

```lisp
(<function> <arg1> <arg2> ... <argN>)
; ^ car ^  |        ^ cdr ^
```

When S-Expressions like this are evaluated, they automatically return some value
which takes the place of this expression. When writing your own functions (using
`defun`), the last value within the body of the `defun` is automatically
returned. For example, if you define the following function:

```lisp
(defun gimme-foo () 'foo)
```

Then call the function as an S-Expression (note that `gimme-foo` has no
arguments):

```lisp
(gimme-foo)
```

Lisp evaluates this to:

```lisp
'foo
```

Functions and the use of `defun` will be discussed in much greater detail in
later concept exercises.

## Symbols and Quoting

There are a couple of things to explain regarding the example above; for
example, what is `foo`? The _symbol_ `foo` is an example of an atom, as it only
has one "part" (unlike a cons which has two). Symbols in Lisp are special names
that can point to other values or, in the case of _keywords_, themselves. When
symbols are evaluated by Lisp, they are replaced with the values they point
to. For example:

```lisp
foo  ; => <whatever-foo-points-to>
:foo ; => :foo

```

Note that keywords are denoted by a leading colon (`:`).

Given that all code in Common Lisp is composed of S-Expressions, what stops Lisp
from trying to evaluate _everything_ in your program? Why didn't Lisp try to
evaluate `'foo` from the `defun` example above? The answer comes in the form of
"quoting".

Quoting – the addition of `'` before an S-expression – tells Lisp to not
evaluate that expression. By quoting `'foo`, we avoided Lisp attempting to look
up (and failing to find) whatever `foo` was supposed to point to, instead,
returning the value `'foo` itself. For example, if `foo` has not been defined
anywhere in our program:

```lisp
foo  ; => <ERROR! Lisp doesn't know what foo points to!>
'foo ; => 'foo
```

In the above example, quoting `foo` makes it look a lot like a keyword, but
unlike keywords (which can only be symbols), all S-Expressions can be quoted:

```lisp
(gimme-foo)  ; => 'foo
'(gimme-foo) ; => '(gimme-foo)
```

## Truthy and Falsy Values

The last important thing to know for this exercise is that Common Lisp doesn't
have a special boolean type for expressing "true" and "false"; rather, the
special symbol `nil` and the empty list / cons `'()` are regarded as "false"
values and all other values are "true". Conventionally, however, functions in
Common Lisp will return the symbols `nil` for false and `t` for true.
