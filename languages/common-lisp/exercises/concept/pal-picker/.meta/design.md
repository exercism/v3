## Learning objectives

- Know how to use `when` and `unless` for single-branch conditions
- Know how to use `if` for two-branch conditions
- Know how to use `cond` for multi-branch conditions
- Know how to use `case` and `ecase` for special, multi-branch conditions
- Understand which values are "false" and which are "true"

## Out of scope

- Sameness / Equality (`eq`, `eql`, `equal`, `equalp`, etc.)
- Short-circuit evaluation with `and` and `or`
- Conditions and restarts â€“ those are _very_ different ;)
- The `ccase` macro, which actually does involve conditions and restarts
- The type-matching `typecase` macro
- Any non-conditional or compound form of control flow

## Concepts

- `conditionals`
- `truthy-and-falsy`

## Prerequisites

- `expressions`
- `integers`
- `arithmetic`
- `symbols`
