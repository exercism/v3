# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student about the basic structure of
Common Lisp S-expressions (and consequentially, the structure of Common Lisp
code).

## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of `atoms` and `cons` cells
- Know how to test if a data is an `atom` or a `cons` using the `atom` and
  `consp` predicates
- Know how to access the `first` and `rest` elements of a `cons` cell

## Out of scope

- Any other list / sequence specific functions
- Any macros (like `loop`) that deviate from the sexpr structure
- Functions or parameters

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

_TBD_

## Prequisites

There are no prerequisites.

## Representer

This exercise does not require any specific representation logic to be added to the [representer][representer].

## Analyzer

This exercise does not require any specific logic to be added to the [analyzer][analyzer].
