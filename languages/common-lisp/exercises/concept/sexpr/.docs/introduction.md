All Common Lisp code is made from S-Expressions (or sexpr for short). An S-Expression is either an atom or a list (also termed a 'cons'). 

A cons is made up of two parts: the first element and the rest of the elements. For historical reasons these two parts are called the `car` and the `cdr`.

Lisp contains functions to determine if a thing is an atom or a cons.
