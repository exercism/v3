## 1. The maze of object equality

- This maze needs the most restrictive equality predicate available.

## 2. The maze of numbers

- The two functions needed for this will not necessarily use the same equality predicates. The first room needs one that is more restrictive than the second.

## 3. The maze of characters

- The two functions needed for this will not necessarily use the same equality predicates. The first room needs one that is more restrictive than the second.

## 4. The maze of strings

- The two functions needed for this will not necessarily use the same equality predicates. The first room needs one that is more restrictive than the second.

## 5. The maze of conses

- This keys for these rooms will need to use equality predicates which are defined to check the contents of conses.

## 6. The maze of arrays

- This keys for these rooms will need to use equality predicates which are defined to check the contents of arrays.
