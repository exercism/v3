## Learning objectives

- Be familiar with `eq`, `eql`, `equal` and `equalp` and how each builds upon the previous.
- Understand when _not_ to use `eq`.
- Know that most standard functions use `eql` for equality. (The exercise could use `find` or `position` for example).

## Out of scope

- Understand that `=` works for numbers and does some 'conversion' of numbers (will be discussed in numeric concept exercises)
- conses, arrays, hash tables, structures. These are needed to teach the concept but are not being taught in this exercise.
- type specific equality predicates such as `char=`, `string=` etc. These may be mentioned but are not being taught. (They can be taught in the exercises for the concept of the specific types.)
