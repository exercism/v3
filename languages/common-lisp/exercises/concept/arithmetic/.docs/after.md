## Reference

```lisp
;;; This section should contain a list of code snippets showcasing the syntax
;;; learned during the exercise. For example:

;; Testing for atoms
(atom 'foo)       ; => T
(atom '(bar baz)) ; => NIL

;; Testing for cons
(consp 'foo)       ; => NIL
(consp '(bar baz)) ; => T

;; And so on...
```
