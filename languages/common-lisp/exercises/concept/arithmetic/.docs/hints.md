## General

- It might be useful to have a list of all of the numeric operations in Lisp –
you can find a [full list here](http://l1sp.org/cl/12.1.1)

## 1. A Dough Ratio

- Common Lisp has [a built-in constant](http://l1sp.org/cl/pi) for π (pi)
- When it comes to rounding, the CL spec provides [a smattering of
  functions](http://l1sp.org/cl/floor)

## 2. A Splash of Sauce

- There is [a built-in operator](http://l1sp.org/cl/sqrt) that might help you
  take the square-root of a number

## 3. Some Cheese, Please

- For squaring or cubing numbers, there is a [built-in exponentiation
  function](http://l1sp.org/cl/expt)
- You might want to take a look at [this page of rounding
  operations](http://l1sp.org/cl/floor) and check out some of the alternatives
  to `round`.

## 4. A Fair Share

- This part requires using a function you may not have come across before, the
[modulo function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation) (`mod`). This
function gives you the remainder of the division between two numbers.
- For comparing the result of `mod` to another number, [this page of comparison
operators](http://l1sp.org/cl/=).  )
