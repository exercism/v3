## Numerical Types

In Common Lisp, like many languages, numbers come in a few of types â€“ two of the
most basic are:

- Integers: whole numbers without a decimal point (like `-6`, `0`, `25`, `1234`,
  etc.)
- Floating-Point Numbers: fractional or whole numbers including a decimal point (like
  `3.14`, `-1.7`, `99.99`, `2048.0`)

In general, if you are working with only whole numbers, you should prefer
integers as they don't suffer from the same loss of precision as floating-point
numbers do over many calculations.

## Arithmetic & Prefix Notation

Common Lisp uses the standard arithmetic operators for most operations but is
somewhat unique in using a "prefix-notation" as opposed to the more familiar
"infix-notion". More visually:

```lisp
;; Infix-notation (non-lisp languages)
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 ; => 15
;; Prefix-notation (lisp languages)
(+ 1 2 3 4 5) ; => 15
```

While prefix notion turns some operations like `2 + 2` into the somewhat
unfamiliar `(+ 2 2)` form, it makes it much easier to operate on more than one
number at a time.

## Comparing Numbers

Finally, you may find it useful to compare different numbers using functions
like `=` (equal), `/=` (not equal to), and `>=` (greater than or equal to). When
these comparisons are true (as in `(= 1 1)`), they return `T` and when they
aren't (as in `(> 0 1)`), they return `NIL`.
