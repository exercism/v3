## Summary

### Numerical Types

In Common Lisp, like many languages, numbers come in a few types â€“ two of the
most basic are:

- Integers: whole numbers without a decimal point (like `-6`, `0`, `25`, `1234`,
  etc.)
- Floating-Point Numbers: fractional or whole numbers including a decimal point (like
  `3.14`, `-1.7`, `99.99`, `2048.0`)

In general, if you are working with only whole numbers, you should prefer
integers as they don't suffer from the same loss of precision as floating-point
numbers do over many calculations.

### Arithmetic & Prefix Notation

Common Lisp uses the standard arithmetic operators for most operations but is
somewhat unique in using a "prefix-notation" as opposed to the more familiar
"infix-notion". More visually:

```lisp
;; Infix-notation (non-lisp languages)
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 ; => 15
;; Prefix-notation (lisp languages)
(+ 1 2 3 4 5) ; => 15
```

While prefix notion turns some operations like `2 + 2` into the somewhat
unfamiliar `(+ 2 2)` form, it makes it much easier to operate on more than one
number at a time.

### Comparing Numbers

Finally, you may find it useful to compare different numbers using functions
like `=` (equal), `/=` (not equal to), and `>=` (greater than or equal to). When
these comparisons are true (as in `(= 1 1)`), they return `T` and when they
aren't (as in `(> 0 1)`), they return `NIL`.

## Diving Deeper

### Arithmetic Operators With a Single Argument

As a small quirk, the `-` and `/` operators have a special meanings when applied
to only one number:

```lisp
;; A single number passed to `-` is simply negated
(- 4)   ; => -4
(- -32) ; => 32
;; A single number passed to `/` returns the reciprocal
(/ 8)   ; => 1/8
(/ 0.1) ; => 10.0
```

### Arbitrary Precision Integers

In Common Lisp, integers can be arbitrarily large or small, so there is no need
to worry about "overflowing" when working with them. While some other languages
might experience a loss of precision or wrap large numbers, the size of integers
in Common Lisp is limited only by the amount of memory available.

```lisp
;; Big integers are no problem
(expt 2 200) ; => 1606938044258990275541962092341162602522202993782792835301376
```

### More Numerical Types & Operations

While integers and floats are the most common numerical types in Lisp, there
also exists support for rational and complex numbers. These will likely be
touched on in a future exercise, but to hold you over, you can take a peek at
[The Common Lisp
Cookbook](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/numbers.html).

If you are looking for an exhaustive list of numerical operations defined by the
standard, then you can find that [here](http://l1sp.org/cl/12.1.1)

### A More Idiomatic Approach

While this exercise encouraged the use of `=` in solving the final task (in
order to introduce the comparison operators), the standard provides a number of
predicates that can replace the expression you wrote with `mod` and `=`. The
equation from the final task might be more idiomatically written as:

```lisp
(zerop (mod (* pizzas 8) friends))
;; Instead of the more general
(= 0 (mod (* pizzas 8) friends))
```

Note that some more complex expressions, like testing if a number is even
(evenly divisible by 2) have been completely abstracted away.

```lisp
;; Using `mod` and `=`
(= 0 (mod x 2))
;; Using an equivalent, built-in function
(evenp x)
```
