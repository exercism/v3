# How to implement a Common Lisp concept exercise

This document describes how to implement a concept exercise for the
Common Lisp track.

**Please please please read the docs before starting.** Posting PRs without reading these docs will be a lot more frustrating for you during the review cycle, and exhaust Exercism's maintainers' time. Before diving into the implementation, please read up on the following documents:

- [The features of v3][docs-features-of-v3].
- [Rationale for v3][docs-rationale-for-v3].
- [What are concept exercise and how they are structured?][docs-concept-exercises]

As this document is generic, the following
placeholders are used:

- `<SLUG>`: the name of the exercise in kebab-case (e.g. `anonymous-methods`).

Before implementing the exercise, please make sure you have a good
understanding of what the exercise should be teaching (and what not).
This information can be found in the exercise's GitHub issue. Having
done this, please read the [Common Lisp concept exercises
introduction][concept-exercises].

To implement a concept exercise, the following files must be created:

<pre>
languages
└── common-lisp
    └── exercises
        └── concept
            └── &lt;SLUG&gt;
                ├── .docs
                |   ├── instructions.md
                |   ├── introduction.md
                |   ├── hints.md
                |   ├── source.md (required if there are third-party sources)
                |   └── after.md
                ├── .meta
                |   |── config.json
                |   |── design.md
                |   └── example.lisp
                ├── &lt;SLUG&gt;.lisp
                └── &lt;SLUG&gt;-test.lisp
</pre>

## Step 1: adding track-specific files

These files are specific to the Common Lisp track:

- `<SLUG>.lisp`: the stub implementation file, which is the starting
  point for students to work on the exercise.
- `<SLUG>-test.lisp`: the test suite which loads the implementation file and
  FiveAM via quicklisp. Loading this file should _not_ auto-run the tests.
- `.meta/example.lisp`: an example implementation that passes all the
  tests.

## Step 2: adding common files

How to create the files common to all tracks is described in the [how
to implement a concept exercise
document][how-to-implement-a-concept-exercise].

## Step 3: add analyzer (optional)

Some exercises could benefit from having an exercise-specific
[analyzer][analyzer]. If so, specify what analysis rules should be
applied to this exercise and why.

## Step 4: custom representation (optional)

Some exercises could benefit from having an custom representation as
generated by the [Common Lisp representer][representer]. If so,
specify what changes to the representation should be applied and why.

## Inspiration

When implementing an exercise, it can be very useful to look at
already implemented Common Lisp exercises like [`basics`][basics].

You can also check the exercise's [general concepts
documents][reference] to see if other languages have already
implemented an exercise for that concept.

## Help

If you have any questions regarding implementing the exercise, please
post them as comments in the exercise's GitHub issue.
