# Cons Cells

A [cons cell][cons] (also known as a dotted pair due its printed form) is a data structure consisting of a pair of two objects. Cons cells are created with the function `cons` and the items of a cons cell are accessed with `car` and `cdr`.

(The names of the accessor methods are a [historical artifact][why-car-cdr]. The cons cells of the original Lisp implementation were implemented in registers of the IBM 704 computer and the operations used to access them were the `CAR` operation to access the "*C*ontents of the *A*dress part of the *Register" and `CDR` operation to access the "*C*ontents of the *D*ecrement part of the *R\*egister".)

The items in a cons cell can be of any type, including other cons cells. This is how they can be used to implement other data types such as lists and tree.
