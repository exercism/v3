# How to implement a Common Lisp concept exercise

This document describes how to implement a concept exercise for the
Common Lisp track. As this document is generic, the following
placeholders are used:

- `<SLUG>`: the name of the exercise in kebab-case (e.g. `anonymous-methods`).

Before implementing the exercise, please make sure you have a good
understanding of what the exercise should be teaching (and what not).
This information can be found in the exercise's GitHub issue. Having
done this, please read the [Common Lisp concept exercises
introduction][concept-exercises].

To implement a concept exercise, the following files must be created:

<pre>
languages
└── common-lisp
    └── exercises
        └── concept
            └── &lt;SLUG&gt;
                ├── .docs
                |   ├── instructions.md
                |   ├── introduction.md
                |   ├── hints.md
                |   └── after.md (optional)
                ├── .meta
                |   ├── config.json
                |   └── example.lisp
                ├── &lt;SLUG&gt;.asd
                ├── &lt;SLUG&gt;.lisp
                └── &lt;SLUG&gt;-test.lisp
                └── package.lisp
                
</pre>

## Step 1: adding track-specific files

These files are specific to the Common Lisp track:

- `<SLUG>.list`. the stub implementation file, which is the starting
  point for students to work on the exercise.
- `<SLUG>-test.lisp`: the test suite.
- `<SLUG>.asd`: the Common Lisp system file defining `<SLUG>` and
  `<SLUG>/test` systems. The `test-op` of `<SLUG>` should run the test
  in `<SLUG>/test`.
- `package.lisp`: the package definition for both `<SLUG>` and `<SLUG>-test` pacakges.
- `.meta/example.lisp`: an example implementation that passes all the tests.

## Step 2: adding common files

How to create the files common to all tracks is described in the [how
to implement a concept exercise
document][how-to-implement-a-concept-exercise].

## Step 3: add analyzer (optional)

Some exercises could benefit from having an exercise-specific
[analyzer][analyzer]. If so, specify what analysis rules should be
applied to this exercise and why.

## Step 4: custom representation (optional)

Some exercises could benefit from having an custom representation as
generated by the [Common Lisp representer][representer]. If so,
specify what changes to the representation should be applied and why.

## Inspiration

When implementing an exercise, it can be very useful to look at
already implemented Common Lisp exercises like *TBD*. 

You can also check the exercise's [general concepts
documents][reference] to see if other languages have already
implemented an exercise for that concept.

## Help

If you have any questions regarding implementing the exercise, please
post them as comments in the exercise's GitHub issue.
