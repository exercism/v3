Common Lisp is an offshoot of the long-running family of Lisp programming languages. 
It's a multi-paradigm programming language that allows you to choose the approach and paradigm according to your application domain.

Common Lisp has fast prototyping capabilities, and exceptional support for object oriented programming. 
It also boasts a macro system which allows you to adapt the language to your needs, and a run-time environment which allows modification of running applications.
