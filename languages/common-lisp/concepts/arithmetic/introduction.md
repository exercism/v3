Common Lisp uses the standard arithmetic operators for most operations but is
somewhat unique in using a "prefix-notation" as opposed to the more familiar
"infix-notion". More visually:

```lisp
;; Infix-notation (non-lisp languages)
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 ; => 15
;; Prefix-notation (lisp languages)
(+ 1 2 3 4 5) ; => 15
```

While prefix notion turns some operations like `2 + 2` into the somewhat
unfamiliar `(+ 2 2)` form, it makes it much easier to operate on more than one
number at a time.
