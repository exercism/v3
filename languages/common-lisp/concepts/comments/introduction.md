Common Lisp allows the programmer to write "comments" that are ignored by the
computer. Single-line comments begin with one or more semi-colons (`;`) and,
occasionally, you may see the following:

```lisp
(code...) ; => value
```

Where the comment is being used to indicate what value is returned by Common
Lisp after running the code on that line.
