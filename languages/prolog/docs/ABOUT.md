Prolog (short for "Programming Logic") is a [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) and logic
based programming language developed in 1972 by Alain Colmerauer and Philippe Roussel. 
It has many applications, most notably in Artificial Intelligence for its pattern matching abilities over natural language parse trees.

Prolog is written in "facts" and "rules" that define logical formulas, similar to functional programs. 
Learning Prolog is a great way to improve skills with recursion, predicate logic, and constraint logic programming.
