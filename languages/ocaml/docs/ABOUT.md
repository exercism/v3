[OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) is an industrial strength programming language supporting functional, imperative and object-oriented styles - but don't worry if you're not familiar with these, as it's used as a teaching language by a lot of institutions (including Cornell and Princeton). 

One of the best features of OCaml is the rich and powerful [type system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system) - this is useful to catch some mistakes early on saving developers a huge amount of frustration. 
Also, [type inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference) relieves developers from having to specify types in the code - the compiler will work these out for you!

It's used by Facebook (for static code analysis with [Infer](http://fbinfer.com/)) and Jane Street (for providing strong guarantees for their internal trading systems), and has influenced the [F# functional programming language](https://fsharp.org/) and [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/).
