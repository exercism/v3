# Erlang concept exercises

The concept exercises are based on this [list of concepts][reference-shared].

## Implemented exercises

These are the concept exercises that have currently been implemented, as well as the concepts they teach and their prerequisite concepts:

| exercise                                                            | concepts                                   | prerequisites                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |

It's only important that it's reasonably easy to _find_ the exercise. It's okay if the name isn't perfect. We **will** iterate on this.
