Erlang is a functional programming language, used for creating  real-time distributed systems, which can easily scale in size. 

It's best for concurrent applications, such as instant messaging and banking platforms, as each function call has their own process and operates independently.
This is useful as code can run for a very long time without issues occuring. 
Also, processes and message passing are all built into the language by default - no need for any extra libraries!

It was designed within Ericsson, a Swedish telecommunications company, for use in their networks, and is currently used inside telecommunication equipment.
