A leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs

- on every year that is evenly divisible by 4,
- except every year that is evenly divisible by 100,
- unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400.

For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap
year, but 2000 is.

## 1. Write boolean expressions to determine divisibility for the rules given above

## 2. Combine these expressions to a single boolean expression that describes whether a given year `y` is a leap year

<!-- No example is given because any example would give away the solution -->

## 3. Wrap it in the `isleapyear` function

```julia
julia> isleapyear(2000)
true
```
