## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the fundamentals of the boolean expressions and (arithmetic) operators in Julia.
This is a prerequisite for them to understand how unit testing works in Julia, which will be required later in the track.

## Learning objectives
- Know how to use arithmetic operators, in particular the remainder operator.
- Know how to compare two integers for equality.
