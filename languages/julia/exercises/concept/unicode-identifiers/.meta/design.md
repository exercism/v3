## Learning objectives

- Know that identifiers/symbols can be almost any unicode string.
- Know how to use latex and emoji completions in the Julia REPL and common Julia editors.
- Revise custom types, imports, and adding methods to custom types.

### Secondary objectives

- Know that Julia's standard library is made up of packages that behave similarly to any other Julia package.
- Revise simple metaprogramming (TODO: Depends on where this fits into the track progression)
  - â‡’ Know how to construct symbols from tab completion strings.

## Out of scope

- This should not be the first exercise where `@eval`/`eval` is a good solution.
- Defining `show(io::IO, c::Clock)` needlessly increases the size of the solution space.

## Concepts

- `unicode-identifiers`
- `emoji-symbols`

## Prequisites

This exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `composite-types`
- `methods`
- `constants`
- `symbols`: (TODO: see above)
