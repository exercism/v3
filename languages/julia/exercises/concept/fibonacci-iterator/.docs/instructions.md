In this exercise you're going to write an iterator that iterates through the first `n` elements of the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).

## Fibonacci sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers, where every element of the sequence is calculated by adding the two numbers that come before it.
You can think of a sequence as a list of numbers in a certain order.
The first two numbers of the sequence are set to $1$.

The start of the sequence is $1,~1,~2,~3,~5,~8,~13,~21,~34,~55,~89,~\dots$

In maths notation: <!-- TODO: Move this to an info box once they're available -->

$$

a_1 = a_2 = 1\\
a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}

$$

For example, the third element would be $a_3 = a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2$, the fourth would be $a_4 = a_2 + a_3 = 1 + 2 = 3$, and so on.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! note
    Some sources define the first elements as $a_0 = 0$ and $a_1 = 1$.
    However in the context of this exercise, we define the sequence without a $0$-th element.

## 1. Define a `Fib` type with a constructor that takes `n` as argument

```julia
julia> Fib(10)
Fib(10)
```

## 2. Implement `iterate` methods

```julia
julia> for a in Fib(10)
           println(a)
       end
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
55
```

You can ignore integer overflow in your implementation.
The tests will only test for `n` small enough to not cause overflow problems.

## 3. Define the optional methods that make `collect` work

```julia
julia> collect(Fib(10))
10-element Array{Any,1}:
  1
  1
  2
  3
  5
  8
 13
 21
 34
 55
```

<!-- TODO: This may be out of scope -->
## 4. Define the optional methods that are necessary for Julia to infer the type of the elements of the iterator

```julia
julia> collect(Fib(10))
10-element Array{Int64,1}:
  1
  1
  2
  3
  5
  8
 13
 21
 34
 55
```
