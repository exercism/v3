## Learning objectives

- Know the three common conditional statements in Julia
  - `if`-statement
  - Ternary operator
  - Short-circuit Evaluation
- Know when to use which of these

## Out of scope

- Nested ternary operators or short-circuits

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `conditionals`: Exercises that require conditionals as prereq should only depend on this concept. Since these are technically all interchangable, depending on one of these versions makes no sense. However, for the website concept view, separating these into three concepts may make sense.
- `if-statements`
- `ternary-operator`
- `short-circuit-evaluation`

## Prerequisites

- `boolean-expressions`: Obvious. Without boolean expressions, there'd be no condition.
- `strings`: The exercise uses strings for input arguments. Some way to concat strings must be known to the student. Which one is irrelevant. <!-- TODO: Check if this is met -->
