Exercism assumes that you already have some knowledge about the Julia language to the point where you understand the basic concept of a function and know the syntax reasonably well. The Julia language website contains a regularly updated [list of learning resources](https://julialang.org/learning/).
This is the go-to place when looking for books and tutorials on Julia.

For examples on what to do with Julia as well as more specific tutorials, check out [juliabloggers.com](https://www.juliabloggers.com/).

While Exercism itself only supports English at the moment, there are Julia resources available in other languages that you may find helpful as reference material:

- [Introducción a la Programación en Julia](https://introajulia.org/)

Please note: Julia is a rather young and still rapidly evolving language and as such, examples from books or tutorials written for pre-v1.0 versions of Julia may not work anymore without (small) adjustments.
Most resources created after August 2018 (release of 1.0) should be compatible with newer versions of Julia.
