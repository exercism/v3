To install Julia on your system follow the instructions on the [Julia Language Downloads page](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

[JuliaPro](https://juliacomputing.com/products/juliapro.html) includes the latest stable version of Julia, the Juno IDE, a debugger, a Jupyter notebook environment and many of the most popular Julia packages. It is a convenient way to install everything you will need to get started. Please note that JuliaPro may contain outdated versions of packages or the language itself as it focuses on providing a stable installation.

**It is not recommended to install Julia through your operating system's package manager. Those packages are not officially maintained and may cause issues.**

For a local installation, there are multiple IDEs/editor plugins available. The most popular ones are [Juno](http://junolab.org/) and the [VS Code extension](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-vscode). Just follow the instructions on their websites.

If you prefer a more interactive environment, you can use Jupyter notebooks with [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl). Each exercise also comes with a notebook file. The general workflow stays the same, except you can edit your solution in the notebook directly.

A simple way to get started with Julia without the need of a local installation is [Nextjournal](https://nextjournal.com/), a notebook-based online IDE. You just access it from your browser, login and you can start solving exercises. If you just want an online REPL, you can use [Repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/julia).
