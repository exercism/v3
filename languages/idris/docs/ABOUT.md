Idris is a general purpose pure functional programming language with [dependent types](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type). 
Dependent types allow types to be predicated on values, 
meaning that some aspects of a programâ€™s behaviour can be specified precisely in the type. 
It is compiled, with  [eager evaluation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eager_evaluation). 
Its features are influenced by Haskell and ML, and include:

 *  Full dependent types with dependent pattern matching
 *  Simple foreign function interface (to C)
 *  Compiler-supported interactive editing: the compiler helps you write code using the types
 *  where clauses, with rule, simple case expressions, pattern matching let and lambda bindings
 *  Dependent records with projection and update
 *  Interfaces (similar to type classes in Haskell)
 *  Type-driven overloading resolution
 *  do notation and idiom brackets
 *  indentation significant syntax
 *  Extensible syntax
 *  Cumulative universes
 *  Totality checking
 *  [Hugs](http://www.haskell.org/hugs/) style interactive environment
