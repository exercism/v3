## GNU Make

There is a `Makefile` provided with every exercise, so it is sufficient to simply run

```shell
make
```

## Idris-PKG

The `Makefile` mentioned above is just a wrapper around the `idris` executable, which has some simple package management stuff built in.

```shell
idris --testpkg *.ipkg
```
