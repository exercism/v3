## Learning Crystal

* [Crystal Official Docs](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/): This is the go-to learning resource for Crystal at the moment. And they are pretty exhaustive, right from the basic literals and variables to some advanced stuff like macros. They also have a neat [doc on coding conventions](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/conventions/index.html).

* [Crystal for Rubyists](http://www.crystalforrubyists.com/): A practical intro to Crystal language.

* Crystal Playground - While Crystal doesn't have a built-in REPL (like Ruby, Python or Node), it does have a way to somewhat easily experiment with code. Just run `crystal play` and you should have a place to play around with Crystal in your browser at localhost:8080.

* Crystal REPL Add-on - A GitHub user has created a REPL of sorts for Crystal. It's called [ICR](https://github.com/greyblake/crystal-icr) (a nod to Ruby's IRB). As most things in Crystal, it's still in a nascent phase and might be prone to bugs.
