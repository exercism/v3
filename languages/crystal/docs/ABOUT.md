Crystal is a compiled language that is currently in the alpha stages of development. 
These are some of the language's goals:

* Ruby-inspired syntax.

* Statically type-checked but without having to specify the type of variables or method arguments.

* Be able to call C code by writing bindings to it in Crystal.

* Have compile-time evaluation and generation of code, to avoid boilerplate code.

* Compile to efficient native code.
