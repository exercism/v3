[Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/) is a syntax and toolchain geared towards Javascript programmers, based on the functional language [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/)

Being statically typed, it is likely to be safer than Javascript, but has powerful type inference which means type annotations do not get in your way.

The Exercism exercises will compile directly to JS, but Reason can be compiled via the OCaml toolchain to native code, IoS, Android, and even [microcontrollers](http://www.algo-prog.info/ocapic/web/index.php?id=ocapic)
