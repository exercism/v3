Exercism provides exercises and feedback but can be difficult to jump into for those learning Reason for the first time. These resources can help you get started:

[Reason home page](https://reasonml.github.io/)
[Programmer blog](https://lucasmreis.github.io/blog/learning-reasonml-part-1/)

ReasonML can use [Belt](https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/api/Belt.html) the standard library shipped with Bucklescript (the underlying Ocaml system which it overlays).
