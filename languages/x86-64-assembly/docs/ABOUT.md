x86-64 assembly is the programming language for the 64-bit version of the x86
instruction set. It is based on the original 8086 instruction set from 1978.

Assembly language is different from high-level languages like C# and Java.
There are no variables, objects, or loops. Instead, you'll have to deal with
registers, memory addresses, and jumps.

Learning assembly can be intimidating at first, but it will give you a better
understanding in how your computer works. It might even improve your
programming skills in higher level languages.
