## Running Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
make
```

## Solving the exercise

Solving an exercise means making all its tests pass. By default, only one test
(the first one) is executed when you run the tests. This is intentional, as it
allows you to focus on just making that one test pass. Once it passes, you can
enable the next test by removing the `TEST_IGNORE()` line. When all tests have
been enabled and your implementation makes them all pass, you'll have solved
the exercise!
