## General

- Read about basic arithmetic operators in [A Tour of Swift: Arithmetic Operators][arithmeticoperators].
- Browse the [`Int`][int] and [`Double`][double] documentation to learn about functions and operators that work with `Int`s and `Double`s.

## 1. Calculate the daily rate given an hourly rate

- You will need to explicitly convert between `Int` and `Double`..

## 2. Calculate the monthly rate, given an hourly rate and a discount

- There is a [method available][double] for rounding floats `Double`s.

## 3. Calculate the number of workdays given a budget, hourly rate and discount

- There is a [method available][double] for rounding floats `Double`s.
