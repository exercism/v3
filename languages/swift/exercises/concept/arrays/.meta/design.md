Of the primary Swift collection types, we chose to use the `Array` collection type as the first collection type students will be taught for the following reasons:

- Arrays are a common data type in many languages.
- Arrays use `Int` indices making subscripting more natural.
- Arrays have a simple liter syntax. No need to understand how constructors work to define an array.

## Learning objectives

- The existence of the `Array` type.
- Defining an array using array literals.
- Accessing elements in an array by index.
- Updating an element in an array by index.
- Basic array functions (adding and removing elements, retreiving the number of elements).
- Iterating over the elements of an array

## Out of scope

- Multi-dimensional arrays.
- ArraySlices.
- Memory and performance characteristics of arrays.
- Any higher-order functions, including map, filter, reduce.
- Array initialization functions.

## Concepts

- `arrays`: know of the existence of the `Array` type; know how to define an array; know how to access elements in an array by index; know how to update an element in an array by index; know of some basic functions (like adding and removing elements, retreiving the number of elements); iterating over the elements of an array.

## Prequisites

This exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `basics`: know how to work with `Int`s and how to assign and update variables and functions.
