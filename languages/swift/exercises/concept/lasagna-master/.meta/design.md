This concept exercise should convey a basic understanding of how to work with functions in Swift.

## Learning objectives

- Function definition syntax
- Parameter labels and names
- Multiple function return values
- Default parameters
- Variadic parameters
- In-Out parameters
- Nested functions

## Out of scope

- Closures
- Higher-order functions

## Concepts

- `function-overloading`
- `multiple-return-values`
- `default-parameters`
- `variadic-parameters`
- `inout-parameters`
- `nested-functions`

## Prerequisites

- `arrays`: know of the existence of the `Array` type; know how to define an array; know how to access elements in an array by index; know how to update an element in an array by index; know of some basic functions (like adding and removing elements, retrieving the number of elements); iterating over the elements of an array.
- `tuples`: Know how to create tuples; know how to extract tuple components; know how to decompose tuples; know how to create and extract components of labeled tuples
- `conditionals-if`: Know how to define an if statement.
- `conditionals-switch`: Know how to define a switch statement.

## Analyzer

This exercise could benefit from the following rules added to the the analyzer:

- Verify that the `redWine(layers:)` function uses the five requested nested functions.
