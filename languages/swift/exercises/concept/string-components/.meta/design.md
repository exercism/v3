The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of the String type [Swift][strings].

## Learning objectives

- Know some basic string methods (like finding the index of a character, or splitting a string based on a delimiter).
- Know that String indices are not integers.
- Know how to manipulate String indices

## Out of scope

- String conformance to `Collection`.
- String slicing/Substrings.
- Multi-line strings.
- Raw strings.
- Using standard or custom format strings.
- Type inference.
- Memory and performance characteristics.
- Character views, utf8 views, utf16 views, etc.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `string-components`: Know of the existence of the `String` type; know how to create a string; know of the existence of `String` methods and properties; know some basic string methods; know how to do basic string formatting
- `string-indexing`: know that String indices are not integers; know how to compute string indices with and without limits
- `opaque-indices`: Know what an opaque index is, know how they differ from indices used with array or dictionaries.
- `importing`: Know how to import existing modules

## Prerequisites

- `optionals`: Know of the existence of optional types; know about the nil-related operators (`!`, `?`, `??`); know what the consequences of unwrapping a `nil` value are; know how to compare a value to `nil`; know the existence and use of optional binding
- `arrays`: know how to access elements in an array; iterating over the elements of an array.
