The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of the Swift [String type][strings].

## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the `String` type.
- Know how to create a string.
- Know of the existence of `String` methods and properties
- Know some basic string methods (like finding the index of a character, or splitting a string based on a delimiter).
- Know how to combine strings.
- Know how to iterate over a string
- Know the existence of the `Character` type
- Know how the create a Character
- Know of the existence of `Character` methods and properties
- Know some basic `Character` methods
- Know how to append a `Character` onto a `String`
- Know how to convert a `Character` to a `String`

## Out of scope

- String indexing
- String decomposition
- String conformance to `Collection`.
- String slicing/Substrings.
- Multi-line strings.
- Raw strings.
- Memory and performance characteristics.
- Character views, utf8 views, utf16 views, etc.

## Concepts

- `strings`: Know of the existence of the `String` type; know how to create a string; know of the existence of `String` methods and properties; know some basic string methods; know how to combine strings; know how to iterate over a string
- `characters`: Know the existence of the `Character` type; know how the create a Character; know of the existence of `Character` methods and properties; know some basic `Character` methods; know how to append a `Character` onto a `String`; know how to convert a `Character` to a `String`

## Prerequisites

- `basics`: know what a value is; know how to define a constant; know how to define a variable; know how to define a function

## Analyzer

This exercise could benefit from having an analyzer that can comment on:

- Verify that concatenation is used to construct the result in task 3.
- Verify that string interpolation is used to construct the result in task 4.
- Verify that for-in loops are used in tasks 5 and 6.
