## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to introduce the student to the concept of [Optionals in Swift][optionals].

## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the `nil` literal.
- Know how to define optional types.
- Know about the optional operators (`!`, `?`, `??`).
- Know what the consequences of unwrapping a `nil` value are.
- Know how to compare a value to `nil`.
- Know the existance and use of optional binding.

## Out of scope

- Writing failable initializers.
- Use of `as?` or `try?`.
- The `.some(T)`/`.none` enum interface of Optionals.
- Casting using the `as` or `is` operator or using pattern matching.

## Concepts

This Concepts Exercise's Concepts are:

- `optionals`: Know of the existence of the `nil` literal; know how to define optional types; know about the nil-related operators (`!`, `?`, `??`); know what the consequences of unwrapping a `nil` value are; know how to compare a value to `nil`; know the existance and use of optional binding.

## Prerequisites

This Concept Exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `basics`: functions will be defined variables will be introduced and updated.
- `numbers`: know of the existence of the two most commonly used number types, `Int` and `Double`; understand that the former represents signed whole numbers, and the latter floating-point numbers; know of basic operators such as multiplication, comparison and equality; know how to convert from one numeric type to another using conversion operators.
- `conditionals`: using a conditional statement.
