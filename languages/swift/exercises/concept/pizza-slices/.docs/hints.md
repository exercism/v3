## General

- Read about [optionals][optionals]and about [conditionals][conditionals] in Apple's _A Tour of Swift_ .

## 1. Write a function to compute slice sizes which returns nil for invalid input.

- The area of a circle is _pi_ \* _r_<sup>2</sup>, where _r_ is half the diameter.
- You can use type conversion to convert an `Int` to a `Double`.
- A guard-style conditional can be used to exit early if either parameter is invalid.

## 2. Process input from your web application to determine the larger slice.

- Optional binding can be used to determine if an optional has a value and to extract that value if there is one.
- The function can be exited early if you know the what the return value should be without further processing.
- You cannot compare `nil` directly with non-nil values.
- You can use switch statements and optional patterns to compare optional values.
