## General

The individual components of a tuple can be accessed by appending a _.n_ to the name of the tuple, where _n_ is the index of the component, statring with 0.

## 1. Convert coordinates to polar

- The individual components of a labeled tuple can also be accessed by appending a _.label_ to the name of the tuple, where _label_ is the label name of the component.
- The `atan2(_:,_:)`function requires `Foundation` to be imported.
- Floating point types in Swift have the [squareRoot() method][squareroot-docs].

## 2. Merge two database records

- Tuples can be [decomposed and assigned to individual constants or variables][tuples].
- If only some of the tupleâ€™s values are needed, unwanted components can be ignored by using an underscore (`_`) for the variable name when you decompose the tuple.
