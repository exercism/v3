This concept exercise should convey a basic understanding of how to work with tuples in Swift. This concept exercise should therefore teach the student how to create, extract values from, and decompose tuples.

## Learning objectives

- Know how to create tuples
- Know how to extract tuple components
- Know how to decompose tuples
- Know how to create and extract components of labeled tuples

## Out of scope

- Structs or other sum types

## Concepts

The concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `tuples`: Know how to create tuples; know how to extract tuple components; know how to decompose tuples; know how to create and extract components of labeled tuples

## Prerequisites

- `basics`: : know what a value is; know how to define a constant; know how to define a variable; know how to define a function

## Resources to refer to

### Hints

- [Tuples][tuples]

### After

- [Tuples][tuples]
- [Functiuons with multiple return values][multiple-return-values]

## Representer

TBD

## Analyzer

## Implementing

See [the Swift track implementation guide][swift-implementing-concept-exercises] for guidance.
