- Know how to extract tuple components
- Know how to decompose tuples
- Know how to create and extract components of labeled tuples

## Out of scope

- Structs or other sum types

## Concepts

- `tuples`: Know how to create tuples; know how to extract tuple components; know how to decompose tuples; know how to create and extract components of labeled tuples

## Prerequisites

- `basics`: : know what a value is; know how to define a constant; know how to define a variable; know how to define a function
- `strings-and-characters`: Know what a string is
