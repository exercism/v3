### Function types

We have seen before how function signatures are defined using a function name followed by comma-separated list of parameter labels along with their types, followed by `->` and the type of the values returned by the function.

If one were to remove all of the names and labels from this signature, they would be left with the [type of the function][function-types].

```swift
func shoppingList(item: String, quantity: Int) -> String {
  "You need to buy \(quantity) \(item)."
}
// shoppingList: (String, Int) -> String

func repeater(_ phrase: String, times: Int) -> String {
  var result = ""
  for _ in 1...times {
    result += phrase
  }
  return result
}
// repeater: (String, Int) -> String

func printString(line: String) {
  print(line)
}
// printString: (String) -> ()
```

Notice how the types of the first two functions are the same, `(String, Int) -> String`, even though the two functions work veery differently. They both take a `String` and an `Int` as input and return a `String`. And, as one can see from the third function's type, even though the function doesn't appear to return anything, it actually returns `()`, the only value of type `Void`. Note that `()` and `Void` are interchangeable as type names, so the type of `printString` could also be written as `String) -> Void`.

These types can be used in the same manner as any other type in Swift, for example, they can be used in the declaration of variables or constants. And since functions are values in Swift, already existing functions can be assigned to these constants/variables:

```swift
var stringAndIntToString: (String, Int) -> String

stringAndIntToString = shoppingList
stringAndIntToString("carrots", 3)
// => "You need to buy 3 carrots."

stringAndIntToString = repeater
stringAndIntToString("carrots", 3)
// => "carrotscarrotscarrots"
```

As with other variables/constants, the value you assign to it must be of the correct type:

```swift
stringAndIntToString = printShoppingList
// Error: Cannot assign value of type '(String) -> ()' to type '(String, Int) -> String'
```

### Function types as parameter types

As function types can be used anywhere other types can be used, it follows that [they can be used as parameter types][functions-as-parameters] and passed into other functions and called from within those functions.

```swift
func distribute(over strings: [String],
                andInt i: Int,
                function f: (String, Int) -> String
               ) -> [String] {
  var result = [String]()
  for string in strings {
    result.append(f(string, i))
  }
  return result
}
// distribute: ([String], Int, (String, Int) -> String) -> [String]

distribute(over: ["carrots", "eggs", "popsicles"], andInt: 3, function: shoppingList)
// => ["You need to buy 3 carrots.", "You need to buy 3 eggs.", "You need to buy 3 popsicles."]

distribute(over: ["carrots", "eggs", "popsicles"], andInt: 3, function: repeater)
// => ["carrotscarrotscarrots", "eggseggseggs", "popsiclespopsiclespopsicles"]

func apply(functions fs: [(String, Int) -> String],
           to string: String,
           andInt i: Int
          ) -> [String] {
  var result = [String]()
  for f in fs {
    result.append(f(string, i))
  }
  return result

}
// apply: ([(String, Int) -> String], String, Int) -> [String]


apply(functions: [shoppingList, repeater], to: "carrots", andInt: 3)
// => ["You need to buy 3 carrots.", "carrotscarrotscarrots"]
```

### Function types as return types

Similarly, [function types may be used as return types][functions-as-returns] for functions. In other words, one can write functions that create and return other functions. When creating these functions, the function that is returned can use the other parameters passed into the function or the local variables created inside the parent function.

```swift
func makeAdder(base: Int) -> (Int) -> Int {
  func adder(_ i: Int) -> Int {
    base + i
  }
  return adder
}
// makeAdder: (Int) -> (Int) -> Int

let add10 = makeAdder(base: 10)
// add10: (Int) -> Int

let subtract20 = makeAdder(base: -20)
// subtract10: (Int) -> Int

add10(5)
// => 15

subtract20(5)
// => -15
```

### Capturing values

As seen with the `makeAdder(base:)` function above, nested functions are able to access the parameters and variables of their surrounding functions. Additionally, they are able to maintain access to these values after the enclosing function terminates. This action of obtaining and maintaining access is known as [_capturing_][capturing-values].

### Higher-order functions

Functions that take functions as parameters and/or return functions are known as higher order functions. Swift has many higher-order functions in its various libraries. For example, the `sorted(by:)` method available on Swift collections such as `Array` which for an array with elements of type `T` takes a function of type `(T, T) -> Bool` that determines which of two values should come before the other in a sorted Array, returning `true` if the left-hand value should appear first and `false` if the right-hand value should appear first.

Another example is the `contains(where:)` method on collections which for a collection with elements of type `T`, takes a function of type `(T) -> Bool` which returns `true` if the element satisfies some property and `false` otherwise. `contains(where:)` then returns `true` if some element in the collection satisfies this property.

```swift
func longer(_ strA: String, _ strB: String) -> Bool {
  strA.count > strB.count
}
// longer: (String, String) -> Bool

["apple", "ball", "carrot"].sorted(by: longer)
// => ["carrot", "apple", "ball"]

["apple", "ball", "carrot"].sorted(by: >)
// => ["carrot", "ball", "apple"]


func isBig(_ i: Int) -> Bool {
  i > 100
}
// isBig: (Int) -> Bool

func isVowel(_ char: Character) -> Bool {
  switch char.lowercased() {
  case "a", "e", "i", "o", "u": return true
  default: return false
  }
}
// isVowel: (Character) -> Bool

[1, 75, 3, 99].contains(where: isBig)
// => false

"Owl".contains(where: isVowel)
// => true

```

### Escaping functions

There are times that a higher-order function takes another function as a parameter and uses it in a way that the passed-in function is called _after_ the higher-order function terminates. This is known as escaping the higher-order function, and the passed-in function is referred to as an [escaping function][escaping].

This happens most often in asynchronous code, but it can occur in higher-order functions where the passed-in function (or a function that calls it) is returned from the higher-order function. For example:

```swift
func emptyKitchen(_ order: String) -> String {
  "Sorry, we're all out of \(order)."
}

func prepare(order: String, kitchen: (String) -> String) -> (String) -> String {
  func newKitchen(_ newOrder: String) -> String {
    if newOrder == order {
      return "One \(order) coming up!"
    } else {
      return kitchen(newOrder)
    }
  }
  return newKitchen
}
```

Here, the function `prepare` accepts a function for its `kitchen` parameter, then constructs a new function `newKitchen` which may call `kitchen`. This `newKitchen` function is then returned to the caller. Trying to write this function in Swift results in the error: _Escaping local function captures non-escaping parameter 'kitchen'_

Swift raises an error in this case because there are situations where the nested or passed-in function may capture a value that can lead to memory leaks. How this happens and how to prevent these leaks are beyond the scope of this exercise. However, this error can be satisfied by placing the `@escaping` attribute before the passed-in function's type signature.

```swift
func prepare(order: String, kitchen: @escaping (String) -> String) -> (String) -> String {
  func newKitchen(_ newOrder: String) -> String {
    if newOrder == order {
      return "One \(order) coming up!"
    } else {
      return kitchen(newOrder)
    }
  }
  return newKitchen
}

let restaurant =
  prepare(order: "sandwich",
          kitchen: prepare(order: "chicken",
                           kitchen: prepare(order: "steak",
                                            kitchen: emptyKitchen)))

restaurant("pork chop")
// => "Sorry, we're all out of pork chop."
restaurant("chicken")
// => "One chicken coming up!"
```

This attribute signals to the Swift compiler that the author is aware that memory leaks may occur by allowing this function to escape.
