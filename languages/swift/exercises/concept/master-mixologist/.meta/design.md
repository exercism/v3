This concept exercise should convey a basic understanding of how to perform looping in Swift.

## Learning objectives

- The existence and use of for-in loops
- The existence and use of while loops
- The existence and use of repeat loops
- The existence and use of control transfer statements: continue and break
- The existence and use of control transfer labels

## Out of scope

- Loop-like constructs like map, reduce, filter, etc

## Concepts

- `loops`
- `for-loops`
- `while-loops`
- `repeat-while`
- `break`
- `continue`
- `labels`
- `control-transfer`

## Prerequisites

- `arrays`
- `optionals`
- `tuples`

## Analyzer

- We will want to ensure that the student uses the correct loop for each part of the exercise (for loop for `timeToPrepare(drinks:)`, repeat loop for `finishShift(minutesLeft:remainingOrders:)`, etc., and that they use `continue` in `orderTracker(orders:)`. And to ensure that they are not using the higher order functions like `reduce`.
