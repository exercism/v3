## 1. Determine how long it takes to make an order

- A [for-in loop][for-in-loops] can be used to look at one drink at a time.
- You can use a `switch` statement to return the amount of time it takes to make each type of drink.

## 2. Replenish your lime wedge supply

- [Arrays have a method][array-docs] for removing the first element of an array and returning it to you.
- You need to make a variable copy of function parameters if you want to mutate them.

## 3. Finish up your shift

- If we know we still have time left in our shift, we know that we will have to make at least one order. This is a good indication that a [repeat-while loop][repeat-loops] would be a good choice to use.
- [Arrays have a method][array-docs] for removing the first element of an array and returning it to you.

## 4. Track certain orders

- A [for-in loop][for-in-loops] can be used to work on each order one at a time.
- Tuple decomposition can be used to name the individual elements of the tuple in the for-in loop.
- You can use [control transfer statements][control-transfer] to skip to the next iteration of the loop for drinks we don't care about.
