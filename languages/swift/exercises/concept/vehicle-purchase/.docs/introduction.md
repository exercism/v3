There are three primary conditional statements that are used in Swift, `if` statements, `switch` statements, and `guard` statements. The `if` and `switch` statements are similar to those seen in a number of other languages, and `guard` should feel familiar to users of other languages with early exit statements.

## If statement

If statements in Swift are similar to those seen in other languages. E.g.:

```swift
if myValue > 0 {
  print("myValue is positive")
} else {
  print("myValue is not positive")
}
```

With this structure, if the Boolean expression following the `if` evaluates as `true`, the first block of code is run, the second block of code is skipped. And if the Boolean expression evaluates to `false`, the first block of code is skipped, the second block of code is run. In either case, the program continues running at the first line of code following the `if` statement.

There are two variants of this pattern that are available in Swift, the else-if and the no-else variants.

### else-if

In cases where the second block of code would just be another `if` statement, the else-if allows us to clean up the code and remove some indentation from our code by moving the `if` up next to the previous `else` and getting rid of a layer of parentheses.

So if we needed to perform different actions when a string is equal to “apple”, “lemon”, “peach”, or any other string, instead of nesting additional `if` statements inside the else blocks, one can write:

```swift
if str == "apple" {
    print("Let's bake an apple crumble")
} else if str == "lemon" {
    print("Let's bake a lemon meringue pie!")
} else if str == "peach" {
    print("Let's bake a peach pie!")
} else {
    print("Let's buy ice cream.")
}
```

### no-else

And if any if-statement only needs to perform code for one of the cases, the else branch can be left out entirely. So for example, if you are writing software that diagnoses patients and you need to log certain symptoms, like elevated heart rate, instead of writing:

```swift
if heartRate > 100 {
  print("elevated heart rate")
} else {
  ()
}
```

You can drop the else and just write

```swift
if heartRate > 100 {
  print(“elevated heart rate”)
}
```

## switch statements

While the else-if variant of `if` statements cleans things up considerably, there is still a lot of noise in the code from all of the curly braces. This is where the `switch` statement comes into play. In conditional statements with many possible branches, the switch statement shines. Note, however, that `switch` statements do work a bit differently from `if` statements.

Rather than evaluating a Boolean expression and using the value of that expression to choose the code branch that is run, a simple switch statement takes an input value (or expression which it evaluates to obtain the input value) of some type and compares against one or more values of the same type. If a case is found that matches the input value, the corresponding block of code is run.

```swift
switch str {
case "apple":
    print("Let's bake an apple crumble")
case "lemon":
    print("Let's bake a lemon meringue pie!")
case "peach":
    print("Let's bake a peach pie!")
default:
    print("Let's buy ice cream.")
}
```

## guard statements

The `guard` statement in swift is used for early returns from Swift functions when a necessary condition which needs to be met for further processing to continue is not met, e.g.:

```swift
guard myValue = 0 else { return 0 }
let root = myValue.squareRoot()
```

Here, the `guard` checks if the Boolean expression following the `guard` keyword evaluates as true. If it does, then processing continues with the code following the guard statement (here `let root = myValue.squareRoot()`. Otherwise it will execute the code in the else clause. Unlike an `if` statement, a `guard` statement _must_ have an else clause, and unlike the else clause of an if-else, the else clause of a guard _must_ exit the scope of the guard statement. I.e. it must use a control transfer statement she as return, continue, break, or it must throw an error or exit the program.

An example of its use is the sinc function, which is equal to sin(x)/x with sinc(0) defined to be 1, avoiding issues with division by 0. This function can be written in Swift, using a `guard` as:

```swift
func sinc(_ x: Double) -> Double {
    guard x != 0 else { return 1 }
    return sin(x) / x
}

sinc(0)
// => 1
sinc(Double.pi / 2)
// => 0.6366197723675814
```
