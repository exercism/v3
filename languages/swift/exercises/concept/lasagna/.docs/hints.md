## General

- An [integer value](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Functions.html#ID323) can be defined as one or more consecutive digits.

## 1. Define the expected oven time in minutes

- You need to [define a constant](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html#ID310).

## 2. Calculate the remaining oven time in minutes

- You need to [define a function](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Functions.html#ID159) with a single parameter.
- You can use and refer to the previously defined constant by its name.
- You can use the [mathematical operator for subtraction](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Functions.html#ID63) to subtract values.

## 3. Calculate the preparation time in minutes

- You need to [define a function](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Functions.html#ID159) with a single parameter.
- You can use the [mathematical operator for multiplication](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Functions.html#ID63) to multiply values.

## 4. Calculate the total working time in minutes

- You need to define [a function with two parameters](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Functions.html#ID528).
- You can [call one of the other functions](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Functions.html#ID159) you've defined previously.
- You can use the [mathematical operator for addition](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Functions.html#ID63) to add values.
