## 1. Create LogLevel enum

- You will need to define an initializer and a method along with your enum cases.

## 2. Parse log level

- Swift has some [properties][string-first-docs] and [methods][string-dropFirst-docs] for getting [parts of a string][string-prefix-docs].
- You can use a [`switch` statement][switch-statement] to determine the appropriate log level.

## 3. Convert log line to short format

- Methods are defined just like functions, only inside the enum body.
- [Raw Values][enum-raw-values] can simplify the implementation of this method.
- You can refer to the enum value as `self` inside the method body.
