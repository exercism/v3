## General

- The syntax for defining a closure is `{ (parameter list) -> ReturnType in bodyOfClosure }`

## 1. Write a closure to flip two wires

- You can use tuple decomposition to name the individual components of a tuple

## 2. Write a closure to rotate the wires

- You can use tuple decomposition to name the individual components of a tuple

## 3. Implement a wire shuffle generator

- You can return the last bit of a number, `n`, by computing `n % 2`
- You can remove the last bit of a number, `n`, by computing `n / 2`
- You need to make variable copies of function and closure parameters if you want to mutate them.
