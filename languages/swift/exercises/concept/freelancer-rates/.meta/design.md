## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the two most commonly used number types, `Int` and `Double`.
- Understand that an `Int` represents signed whole numbers, and a `Double` represents floating-point numbers.
- Know of basic operators such as multiplication and comparison.
- Know how to convert from one numeric type to another; know that one always has to be explicit.

## Out of scope

- Any other numeric types besides `Int` and `Double` (so no `Float`, `UInt16`, `Decimal`, etc.).
- Parsing a `String` to an `Int` or `Double`.
- Converting an `Int` or `Double` to a `String`.
- Overflows.

## Concepts

- `numbers`: know of the existence of the two most commonly used number types, `Int` and `Double`; understand that the former represents signed whole numbers, and the latter floating-point numbers; know of basic operators such as multiplication, comparison and equality; know how to convert from one numeric type to another using conversion operators.

## Prerequisites

- `basics`: know how to define variables, constants, and functions.
