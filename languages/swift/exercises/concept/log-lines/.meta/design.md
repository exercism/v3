This concept exercise should convey a basic understanding of how to work with enumerations in Swift.

## Learning objectives

- Enumerations
- Methods and initializers
- Raw values
- Switch with enumerations (after only)
- Associated values (after only)
- Indirect / recursive enumerations (after only)

## Out of Scope

- Computed properties
- case let and other pattern matching
- Protocol conformance
- CaseIterable

## Concepts

- `enumerations`

## Prerequisites

- `string-components`
- `structs-and-classes`

## Representer

- TBD

## Analyzer

- Verify that raw values are being used to represent the short format of the cases
