## General

There are three primary types of conditionals in Swift, `if` statements, `switch` statements, and `guard` statements.

## 1. Compute whether or not you can afford the monthly payments on a given car

- Be sure to divide the total price of the car by the number of months to compute the monthly payment.
- You can use `+` to concatenate two strings.

## 2. Determine the type of drivers license you will need

- Switch statements are good for handling a large number of cases cleanly.
- You can handle multiple cases with a single switch case if the behavior should be the same for all of them.
- The `default` case handles all cases not explicitly listed.

## 3. Calculate the registration fees for your new vehicle

- The `guard` statement is used in situations where early exit is desirable because further processing is not needed (or not possible).
- You only need to do computation using the formula if the vehicle is less than 10 years old.
