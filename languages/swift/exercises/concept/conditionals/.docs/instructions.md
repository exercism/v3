In this exercise you're going to write some code to help you help you prepare to buy a new vehicle.

You have three tasks, one to help you determine the price of the vehicle you can afford, one to determine what kind of license you will need to get, and one to help you compute your yearly registration fees.

## 1. Compute whether or not you can afford the monthly payments on a given car

The auto dealers in your town are all running a five year, 0% interest promotion that you would like to take advantage of. Define the `canIBuy` function that takes the name of the vehicle you are looking at, the price of the car, and your monthly budget and returns a string letting you know whether you can afford the car or not, if the monthly payment is within 10 of your monthly budget you will want to return a special reminder to be frugal:

```swift
canIBuy(vehicle: "1974 Ford Pinto", price: 516.32, monthlyBudget: 100.00)
// => "Yes! I'm getting a 1974 Ford Pinto"
canIBuy(vehicle: "2011 Bugatti Veryon", price: 2_250_880.00, monthlyBudget: 10000.00)
// => "Darn! No 2011 Bugatti Veryon for me"
canIBuy(vehicle: "2020 Indian FTR 1200", price: 12,500, monthlyBudget: 200)
// => "I'll have to be frugal if I want a 2020 Indian FTR 1200"
```

## 2. Determine the type of drivers license you will need

Define the `licenceType` function that takes the number of wheels on your new vehicle and returns the type of license you will need. Vehicles with 2 or 3 wheels will require a motorcycle license, vehicles with 4 or 6 wheels will require an automobile license, vehicles with 18 wheels require a commercial trucking license, and any other number of wheels returning an failure message:

    case 2,3: return "You will need a motorcycle license for your vehicle"
    case 4,6: return "You will need a automobile license for your vehicle"
    case 18:  return "You will need a commercial trucking license for your vehicle"
    default:  return "We do not issue licenses for those types of vehicles"

```swift
licenceType(numberOfWheels: 2)
// => "You will need a motorcycle license for your vehicle"
licenceType(numberOfWheels: 6)
// => "You will need an automobile license for your vehicle"
licenceType(numberOfWheels: 18)
// => "You will need a commercial trucking license for your vehicle"
licenceType(numberOfWheels: 0)
// => "We do not issue licences for those types of vehicles"
```

## 3. Calculate the registration fees for your new vehicle

The annual registration fee for your new vehicle is based on the following formula:

- For any vehicle 10 years old or older, the fee is a flat \$25.
- For any newer car:
  - Start with a base cost that is either the Manufacturer's Standard Retail Price (MSRP) for the vehicle, or \$25,000 whichever is greater.
  - Then for each year of age, subtract 10% of the base price.
  - Finally, divide that value by 100. Return the nearest integer dollar amount that is less than or equal to this value.

Define the `registrationFee` function that takes the price of the car and the cars age in years, both as `Int`s as parameters and returns the registration fee for that car, according to the above formula.

```swift
registrationFee(msrp: 2_250_800, yearsOld: 9)
// => 2250
registrationFee(msrp: 25_000, yearsOld: 3)
// => 175
registrationFee(msrp: 34_000, yearsOld: 30)
// => 25
```
