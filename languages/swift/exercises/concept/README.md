# Swift concept exercises

The Concept Exercises are based on this [list of concepts][reference-shared].

## Implemented exercises

This section will be rewritten after everything is renamed.

<!--
These are the Concept Exercises that have currently been implemented, as well as the Concepts they teach and their prerequisite concepts:
