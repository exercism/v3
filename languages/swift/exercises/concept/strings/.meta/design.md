The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of the String type [Swift][strings].

## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the `String` type.
- Know how to create a string.
- Know of the existence of `String` methods and properties
- Know some basic string methods (like finding the index of a character, or splitting a string based on a delimiter).
- Know that String indices are not integers.
- Know how to do basic string formatting (using string interpolation and `String(format:arguments:)`).

## Out of scope

- String conformance to `Collection`.
- String slicing/Substrings.
- Multi-line strings.
- Raw strings.
- Using standard or custom format strings.
- Type inference.
- Memory and performance characteristics.
- Character views, utf8 views, utf16 views, etc.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `strings`: Know of the existence of the `String` type; know how to create a string; know of the existence of `String` methods and properties; know some basic string methods; know that String indices are not integers; know how to do basic string formatting

## Prequisites

- `basics`: know what a value is; know how to define a constant; know how to define a variable; know how to define a function
- `optionals`: Know of the existence of optional types; know about the nil-related operators (`!`, `?`, `??`); know what the consequences of unwrapping a `nil` value are; know how to compare a value to `nil`; know the existance and use of optional binding
- `arrays`: know how to access elements in an array; iterating over the elements of an array.

## Representer

TBD

<!--This exercise does not require any specific representation logic to be added to the representer][representer].-->

## Analyzer

TBD

<!--[This exercise could benefit from the following rules added to the the analyzer][analyzer]:
- Verify that string interpolation is preferred to string concatenation.
