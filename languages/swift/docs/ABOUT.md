Swift is a modern open source programming language that runs on macOS, Linux and on Windows using a linux subsystem. 

Swift was developed initially by Apple to interoperate with their key frameworks, Cocoa and CocoaTouch, both of which are mostly implemented in Objective-C. 

Swift is influenced by a large number of existing programming languages, and it incorporates concepts from a wide range of programming methods. Everything from scripting to object oriented and functional programming. 

Apple refers to Swift as a "protocol oriented programming language" and has expressed the goal of eventually making Swift useful for everything from scripts to an operating system.
