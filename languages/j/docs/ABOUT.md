APL is a mistake, carried through to perfection. It is the language of the future for the programming techniques of the past: it creates a new generation of coding bums.<br />

J is a strange language that can challenge how you think about building programs. It talks in terms of speech &#x2013; the parts of which include nouns, verbs, adverbs, conjunctions, gerunds, copulas, and so on. It borrows terms from music and chemistry where verbs, adverbs, and conjunctions are monads or dyads depending on how they bond to their operands. J is also extremely concise; useful programs can be expressed in very few keystrokes.
