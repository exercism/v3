# F&#35; shared exercise documents

There are two documents that are shared between all exercises:

- [cli.md][cli]: contains information on how to work with the exercise when using the CLI to download and submit the exercise.
- [debug.md][debug]: explains how a user that is coding in the browser can still do "debugging."

## Contributing

To contribute, please submit a PR if you feel the [cli.md][cli] or [debug.md][debug] document can be improved.
