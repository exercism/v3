# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student how the Concept of Floating-point numbers is implemented in [F#][floating-point-numbers]. It will show the available floating-point types and discuss their differences.

## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the three floating point types: `double`, `float` and `decimal`.
- Know when to use which floating point type.

## Out of scope

- Parsing floating-point types from strings.
- Converting floating-point types to strings.
- Using standard or custom format strings.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `numbers-floating-point`: know of the existing of the three floating point types: `double`, `float` and `decimal`. know when to use which floating point type.

## Prequisites

This exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `numbers-basic`: define numbers and apply arithmetic and boolean logic to them.
- `type-conversion-numbers`: convert from one floating-point type to another.
- `conditionals-if`: conditionally execute code based on value of floating-point numbers.

## Representer

This exercise does not require any specific representation logic to be added to the [representer][representer].

## Analyzer

This exercise does not require any specific logic to be added to the [analyzer][analyzer].
