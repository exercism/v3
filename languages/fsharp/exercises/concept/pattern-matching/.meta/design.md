## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of the Concept of Pattern Matching in [F#][pattern-matching].

## Learning objectives

- Know what pattern matching is.
- Know how to use `match` to use pattern matching.
- Know about constant, variable and wildcard patterns.
- Know how to apply guards to patterns.
- Know about exhaustiveness checking in pattern matching.

## Out of scope

- Other patterns besides the constant and wildcard patterns.
- Active patterns.
- `function` pattern shorthand notation.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `pattern-matching`: know what pattern matching is; know about constant, variable and wildcard patterns; know how to apply guards to patterns; know about exhaustiveness checking in pattern matching.

## Prequisites

This exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `strings`: use to pattern match on.
- `conditionals`: know what an `if/elif/else` statement is.
