In F#, a _value_ is everything that has a type and can be defined. That includes booleans, integers and lists, but also functions. Integer values are defined as one or more (consecutive) digits and support the [default mathematical operators][operators].

Assigning a value to a name is referred to as a _binding_. [Bindings][bindings] are immutable, which makes them similar to constants in other languages. Bindings are defined using the `let` keyword.

As F# is a statically-typed language, each binding has a type. Specifying a binding's type is optional for most bindings, as F#'s _type inference_ can usually infer the type based on their value.

```fsharp
// Automatically inferred type
let fingers = 10
```

[Functions][functions] are also regular bindings, but with one or more parameters. A function automatically returns its last expression. Type inference also works for most functions, by analyzing what values the function is called with and what value the function returns.

```fsharp
// Automatically inferred types for parameters and return type
let add x y = x + y
```

Invoking a function is done by specifying its name and passing arguments for each of the function's parameters.

```fsharp
let five = add 2 3
```

If a binding's type cannot be inferred, the compiler will report an error. To fix this, make the binding's type explicit.

```fsharp
// Explicit type annotation
let fingers: int = 10

// Explicit type annotation (also for parameters)
let add (x: int) (y: int): int = x + y
```

Bindings in F# can only be used _after_ they have been defined. Using a binding before it has been defined results in a compile error.

```fsharp
// Compile error as the add binding has not yet been defined
// let seven = add 3 + 4

let add x y = x + y
```

Significant whitespace is used to define scope, by indenting code with spaces relative to the line declaring the binding. The default convention is to use four spaces for indentation.

```fsharp
let toes =
    let left = 5
    let right = 5
    left + right

let multiplyPlusTwo x y =
    let product = x * y
    product + 2

// Trying to access the left, right or product bindings
// here would result in a compile error
```

F# supports two types of [comments][comments]. Single line comments are preceded by `//` and multiline comments are inserted between `(*` and `*)`.
