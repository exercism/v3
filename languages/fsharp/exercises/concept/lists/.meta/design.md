# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of the Concept of Lists in [F#][lists].

## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the `list` type.
- Know that lists are immutable.
- Know what head and tail refer to.
- Know how to define an empty and non-empty list.
- Know how to add an element to a list.
- Know some common list functions (counting, reversing).
- Know how to pattern match on lists.

## Out of scope

- Iterating over lists.
- Concatenating lists.
- Recursion.
- Higher-order list functions.
- Memory and performance characteristics.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `lists`: know of the existence of the `list` type; know how to define an empty and non-empty list; know how to add an element to a list; know some common list functions; know how to pattern match on lists.

## Prequisites

This exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `strings`: the lists are lists of strings.
- `booleans`: return a `bool`.
- `pattern-matching`: know how to do pattern matching.
