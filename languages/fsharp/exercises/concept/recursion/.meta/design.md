## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of the Concept of Recursion in [F#][recursion]. It will do this both by teaching about recursive functions as well as recursive types.

## Learning objectives

- Know what recursion is.
- Know how to define a recursive function.
- Know how to define a recursive type.
- Know how to write a tail-recursive function.

## Out of scope

- Continuations.
- Mutually recursive functions.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `recursion`: know what recursion is; know how to define a recursive function; know how to define a recursive type; know how to write a tail-recursive function.

## Prequisites

This exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `pattern-matching`: know how to do basic pattern matching.
- `discriminated-unions`: know how to do define functions and work with parameters.
- `lists`: know how to work with lists.
- `higher-order-functions`: know how to define inner functions.
