## 1. Define the pizza types and options

- The `Pizza` type is a [recursive type][recursive-types], with the `ExtraSauce` and `ExtraToppings` cases "wrapping" a pizza.

## 2. Calculate the price of pizza

- To handle the `Pizza` type being a [recursive type][recursive-types], define a [recursive function][recursive-functions].

## 3. Calculate the price of an order

- If the test fails with a Stack overflow, please use [tail-recursion][tail-recursion] to recursively process the list.
