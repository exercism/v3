# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of the Concept of Arrays in F#.

## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the `Array` type
- Know that arrays have a fixed length
- Know that arrays are mutable
- Know how to define an array
- Accessing elements in an array by index
- Know how to update a value in an array
- Know some common array functions (summing values)
- Know how to pattern match on arrays

## Out of scope

- Multi-dimensional/jagged arrays
- Iterating over arrays
- Concatenating arrays
- Pattern matching on array
- Recursion
- Higher-order array functions
- Memory and performance characteristics

## Concepts

This Concepts Exercise's Concepts are:

- `arrays`: know of the existence of the `Array` type; know that arrays have a fixed length; know that arrays are mutable; know how to define an array; accessing elements in an array by index; know how to update a value in an array; know some common array functions (summing values); know how to pattern match on arrays.

## Prequisites

This exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `booleans`: return a `bool`.
- `pattern-matching`: know how to do pattern matching.
- `basics`: know how to work with `integers` and how to assign and update variables.
