# F&#35; concept exercises

The Concept Exercises are based on this [list of concepts][reference-shared].

## Implemented exercises

These are the Concept Exercises that have currently been implemented, as well as the Concepts they teach and their prerequisite concepts:

| exercise                                                            | concepts                                                            | prerequisites                                                                  |

| [`numbers`][concept-exercise-numbers]                               | `numbers-basic`<br/>`type-conversion-numbers`<br/>`conditionals-if` | -                                                                              |
| [`numbers-floating-point`][concept-exercise-numbers-floating-point] | `numbers-floating-point`                                            | `numbers-basic`<br/>`type-conversion-numbers`<br/>`conditionals-if`            | - |
| [`recursion`][concept-exercise-recursion]                           | `recursion-basic`<br/>`pattern-matching-lists`                      | `pattern-matching-basic`<br/>`discriminated-unions-basic`<br/>`integers-basic` |
| [`strings`][concept-exercise-strings]                               | `strings-basic`                                                     | -                                                                              |

**⚠ Note ⚠**: The idea here is to use a `concept` name for the exercise/folder, but perhaps use some sort of "progression", so they will naturally become a sort of path to traverse. For example, the `numbers` exercise only teaches basic number usage, and the `numbers-floating-point` exercise builds on that and digs deeper into floating-point numbers.

It's only important that it's reasonably easy to _find_ the exercise. It's okay if the name isn't perfect. We **will** iterate on this.
