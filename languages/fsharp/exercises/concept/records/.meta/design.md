# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of the Concept of Records in F#.

## Learning objectives

- Know what a record is
- Know when records should be used
- Know how to define records
- Know that records have structural equality
- Know how to deconstruct records (including as parameters)
- Know how to pattern match on records
- Know that records are immutable
- Know how to return a modified copy of a record
- Know how type inference works for records

## Out of scope

- `struct` records
- Adding members to records
- Mutually recursive records
- Know the difference between records and classes
- Memory and performance characteristics

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `records`: know what a record is; know when records should be used; know how to define records; know that records have structural equality; know how to deconstruct records (including as parameters); know how to pattern match on records; know that records are immutable; know how to return a modified copy of a record; know how type inference works for records

## Prequisites

This exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `numbers`: know what an `int` is and how to compare them
- `strings`: know what a `string` is
- `booleans`: know what a `bool` is
- `pattern-matching`: know how to do pattern matching
