# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of the Concept of Values in [F#][values].

## Learning objectives

- Know what a value is.
- Know how to define a binding.
- Know how to define a variable.
- Know what immutability is.
- Know that bindings are immutable and variables are mutable.
- Know what type inference is.
- Know how type inference works for bindings and variables.

## Out of scope

- Functions.
- Type inference for functions.
- Generic values.
- Reference cells.
- Naming rules for identifiers.
- Double-quoted identifiers.
- Shadowing.
- Memory and performance characteristics.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `values-basic`: know what a value is; know how to bind a value to a name by defining a binding; know how to define a variable.
- `immutability-basic`: know what immutability is; know that bindings are immutable and variables are mutable.
- `integers-basic`: know how to define an integer; know how to use mathematical operators on integers.
- `type-inference-basic`: know what type inference is; know how type inference works for bindings and variables.

## Prequisites
