In this exercise you're going to write some code to help you cook a brilliant lasagna from your favorite cooking book.

You have two tasks, both related to keeping track of the time the lasasgna has to spend in the oven.

### 1. Check how many minutes the lasasgne should be in the oven

Define the `expectedMinutesInOven` binding to check how many minutes the lasagne should be in the oven. According to the cooking book, the expected oven time in minutes is 40:

```fsharp
expectedMinutesInOven
// 40
```

### 2. Keep track of how many minutes the lasasgne has been be in the oven

Define the `actualMinutesInOven` variable to keep track of the number of minutes the lasagna has been in the oven. At this moment, the lasagne has already been in the oven for 15 minutes:

```fsharp
actualMinutesInOven
// => 15
```
