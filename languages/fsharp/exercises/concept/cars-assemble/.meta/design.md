## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the two most commonly used number types, `int` and `float`.
- Understand that an `int` represents whole numbers, and a `float` represents floating-point numbers.
- Know of basic operators such as multiplication and comparison.
- Know how to convert from one numeric type to another; know that one always has to be explicit.
- Know how to conditionally execute code using an `if/elif/else` statement.

## Out of scope

- Any other numeric types besides `int` and `float` (so no `single`, `byte`, etc.).
- Parsing a `string` to an `int` or `float`.
- Converting an `int` or `float` to a `string`.
- Overflows.

## Concepts

- `numbers`: know of the existence of the two most commonly used number types, `int` and `float`; understand that the former represents whole numbers, and the latter floating-point numbers; Know of basic operators such as multiplication, comparison and equality; know how to convert from one numeric type to another using conversion operators.
- `conditionals`: know how to conditionally execute code using an `if` expressions.

## Prerequisites

- `basics`: know how to define functions.
