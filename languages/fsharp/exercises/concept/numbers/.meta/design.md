# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student how the Concept of Numbers is implemented in F#. It will introduce this concept through the two most common numeric types in F#: `int` (whole number) and `double` (floating-point number).

## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the two most commonly used number types, `int` and `double`.
- Understand that an `int` represents whole numbers, and a `double` represents floating-point numbers.
- Know of basic operators such as multiplication and comparison.
- Know how to convert from one numeric type to another; know that one always has to be explicit.
- Know how to conditionally execute code using an `if/elif/else` statement.

## Out of scope

- Any other numeric types besides `int` and `double` (so no `float`, `byte`, etc.).
- Parsing a `string` to an `int` or `double`.
- Converting an `int` or `double` to a `string`.
- Overflows.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `numbers-basic`: know of the existence of the two most commonly used number types, `int` and `double`; understand that the former represents whole numbers, and the latter floating-point numbers; now of basic operators such as multiplication and comparison.
- `type-conversion-numbers`: know how to convert from one numeric type to another using conversion operators.
- `conditionals-if`: know how to conditionally execute code using an `if` expressions.
