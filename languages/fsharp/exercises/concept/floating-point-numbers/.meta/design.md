## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the three floating point types: `double`, `float` and `decimal`.
- Know when to use which floating point type.

## Out of scope

- Parsing floating-point types from strings.
- Converting floating-point types to strings.
- Using standard or custom format strings.

## Concepts

- `floating-point-numbers`: know of the existing of the three floating point types: `double`, `float` and `decimal`. know when to use which floating point type.

## Prequisites

- `numbers`: define numbers and apply arithmetic and boolean logic to them and convert from one floating-point type to another.
- `conditionals`: conditionally execute code based on value of floating-point numbers.
