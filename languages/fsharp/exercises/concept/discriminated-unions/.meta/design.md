# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of the Concept of Discriminated Unions in [F#][discriminated-unions].

## Learning objectives

- Know what discriminated unions are.
- Know how discriminated unions are different from enums.
- Know how to define a discriminated union, with and without data.
- Know how to pattern match on discriminated unions.

## Out of scope

- Recursive discriminated unions.
- Single type wrapper discriminated unions.
- Active patterns.
- Adding members to discriminated unions.
- `function` pattern shorthand notation.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `discriminated-unions`: know what discriminated unions are; know how discriminated unions are different from enums; know how to define a discriminated union, with and without data; know how to pattern match on discriminated unions.

## Prequisites

This exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `basics`: defining functions and scoping and using integers.
- `pattern-matching`: know how to do pattern matching.

## Representer

This exercise does not require any specific representation logic to be added to the [representer][representer].

## Analyzer

This exercise does not require any specific logic to be added to the [analyzer][analyzer].
