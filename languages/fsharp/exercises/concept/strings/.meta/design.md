## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of the Concept of Strings in [F#][string].

## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the `string` type.
- Know how to create a string.
- Know of the existence of `string` methods and `String` module function

- Triple-quoted strings.
- Double-backtick strings.
- Advanced string formatting (combining types or using `StringBuilder`).
- Using standard or custom format strings.
- Type inference.
- Memory and performance characteristics.

## Concepts
