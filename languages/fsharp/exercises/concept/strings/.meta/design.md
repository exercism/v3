# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of the Concept of Strings in [F#][string].

## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the `string` type.
- Know how to create a string.
- Know of the existence of `string` methods and `String` module function
- Know some basic string methods (like finding the index of a character at a position, or returning a part the string).
- Know how to do basic string formatting (using `+` and `sprintf`).
- Know that strings are immutable.

## Out of scope

- Strings can be enumerated.
- String slicing.
- Triple-quoted strings.
- Double-backtick strings.
- Advanced string formatting (combining types or using `StringBuilder`).
- Using standard or custom format strings.
- Type inference.
- Memory and performance characteristics.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `strings-basic`: know of the existence of the `string` type; know of some basic functions (like looking up a character at a position, or slicing the string); know how to do basic string formatting.

## Prequisites
