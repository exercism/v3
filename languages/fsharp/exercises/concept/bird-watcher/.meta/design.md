## Concepts

- `arrays`: know of the existence of the `Array` type; know that arrays have a fixed length; know that arrays are mutable; know how to define an array; accessing elements in an array by index; know how to update a value in an array; know some common array functions (summing values); know how to pattern match on arrays.

## Prerequisites

- `booleans`: return a `bool`.
- `pattern-matching`: know how to do pattern matching.
- `basics`: know how to work with `integers` and how to assign and update variables.
