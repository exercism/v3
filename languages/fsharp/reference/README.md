## Concepts

The F# concept exercises are based on concepts. The list below contains the concepts that have been identified for the F# language.

### Language-unique

- Active patterns
- Computation expressions
- Dependency order
- Type providers
- Units of measure

### Functional

- [Expression-oriented (not statement oriented)][expression_oriented]
- [Functions][functions]
  - [Anonymous functions][anonymous_functions]
  - Currying
  - [Function composition][function_composition]
  - [Higher-order functions][higher_order_functions]
  - Implicit returns
  - [Nested functions][nested_functions]
  - [Partial application][partial_application]
  - [Pure functions][pure_functions]
  - [Recursion][recursion]
    - Tail recursion
  - Type annotations
- [Immutability][immutability]
- [Pattern matching][pattern_matching]
  - Discards
  - Guard clauses
- [Pipelines][pipelines]
- [Type inference][type_inference]
  - Automatic generalisation

### Object-oriented

The core OO features an F# developer should know about are:

- [Classes][classes]
- [Composition][composition]
- [Encapsulation][encapsulation]
- Fields
- Indexers
- [Interfaces][interfaces]
  - Object expressions
- [Methods][methods]
  - Constructors
  - Method arguments
    - Named arguments
    - [Optional arguments][optional_arguments]
    - Out parameters
- [Mutation][mutation]
  - Reference cells
- [Objects][objects]
- Properties
- [State][state]
- Structs
- Type extensions

While F# has OO features, it is a "functional first" language. It is important to know how and when to apply the OO features, and which OO features (see https://youtu.be/yL7xBhWrdKw?t=2248) to use.

## Concept interpretation

The concept exercises use the following concepts:
