[F#](http://www.tryfsharp.org/Explore) is a strongly-typed, functional language that is part of Microsoft's .NET language stack.

Although F# is great for data science problems, it can elegantly handle almost every problem you throw at it. 

As F# runs on the .NET runtime, you get access to the entire .NET ecosystem, including all packages on [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/). 

Integration with existing .NET code is further simplified due to F# also allowing you to write object-oriented code.

The home page for F# is [fsharp.org](http://fsharp.org/) and a great introduction to F# can be found at the [F# for fun and profit](http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/) website.
