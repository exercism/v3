# How is this repository structured?

This repository can be viewed both via GitHub and via the v3 website. This page describes the repository as found on GitHub. It is roughly equivalent to the website, with filenames being titelized.

This repository is the work-in-progress space as we migrate from v2. Once the C# track is no longer a "work-in-progress," its contents will be moved to the track's repository.

Things are grouped into several subdirectories:

- **docs**: C# track-specific [documentation][docs].
- **exercises**: the [exercises][exercises].
  - **.docs**: [documentation shared][exercises-docs] across all exercises.
  - **concept**: [concept exercises][exercises-concept] (WIP).
  - **practice**: [practice exercises][exercises-practice] (on hold).
- **reference**: C# track-specific [reference documentation][reference].

[docs]: ./docs/README.md
[exercises]: ./exercises/README.md
[exercises-docs]: ./exercises/.docs/README.md
[exercises-concept]: ./exercises/concept/README.md
[exercises-practice]: ./exercises/practice/README.md
