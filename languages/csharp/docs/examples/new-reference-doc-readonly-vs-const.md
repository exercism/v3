# [C#] Add new reference document: readonly vs const

This issue describes how to add a new [C# reference document][reference]: readonly vs const.

## Description

The goal of the new reference document is to explain the different between (`static`) `readonly` fields versus `const` fields, which is confusing to many students.

The document should explain how the two approaches are different, taking into account:

- What values they can be applied to.
- Readability aspects.
- Performance characteristics.
- Memory aspects.
- Generated IL code (optional).

Based on the aforementioned differences, the document should provide guidance on when to use which approach and why.
