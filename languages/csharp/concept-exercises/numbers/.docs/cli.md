# CLI

To run the tests, run the command `dotnet test` from within the exercise directory.

Initially, only the first test will be enabled. This is to encourage you to solve the exercise one step at a time. Once you get the first test passing, remove the `Skip` property from the next test and work on getting that test passing.

Once none of the tests are skipped and they are all passing, you can submit your solution
using `exercism submit Numbers.cs`
