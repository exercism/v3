# Hints

### 1. Check the type 
- This exercise is based on [`pattern match` match](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/pattern-matching)
so be sure to look it over carefully.

### 2. Pattern Match the types 

- Remember you are matching based on what object is sent into the 
method. This means if someone submits a Square
object you should have a pattern that catches it
and evaluates it.

### 3. Implement perimeter math
 
- In this case you just need to return the right 
number that you would get after evaluating
the object. The input is given for you in the test
so all you need to do is complete the math based upon
the objects classes.

### 4. Check for edge cases

- Make sure you check that the method is actually
getting a value
- You can do this several ways [Nullable Types](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/271588/passing-null-arguments-to-c-sharp-methods)
