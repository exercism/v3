The primary object-oriented construct in C# is the _class_, which is a grouping of related data ([_fields_][fields]) and behavior ([_methods_][methods]). The fields and methods of a class are known as its _members_.

Access to members can be restricted through access modifiers, the two most common ones being:

- [`public`][public]: the member can be accessed by any code (no restrictions).
- [`private`][private]: the member can only be accessed by code in the same class.

It is customary to specify an access modifier for all members. If no access modifier is specified, it will default to `private`.

The above-mentioned grouping of related data and behavior plus restricting access to members is known as _encapsulation_, which is one of the core object-oriented concepts.

You can think of a class as a template for creating instances of that class. To [create an instance of a class][creating-objects] (also known as an _object_), the [`new` keyword][new] is used:

```csharp
class Car
{
}

// Create two car instances
var myCar = new Car();
var yourCar = new Car();
```

[Fields][fields] have a type and a name (defined in camelCase) and can be defined anywhere in a class. One can optionally assign an initial value to a field. If a field does _not_ have an initial value, its default value will be used. An instance's field values can be accessed and updated using dot-notation.

```csharp
class Car
{
    // Accessible by anyone, with default value
    public int weight = 2500;

    // Accessible by anyone
    public int year;

    // Only accessible by code in this class
    private string color;
}

var newCar = new Car();
newCar.weight; // => 2500
newCar.year;   // => 0 (default value for int)

// Update value of the field
newCar.year = 2018;
```

Private fields are usually updated as a side-effect of calling a method. Such methods usually don't return any value, in which case the return type should be [`void`][void]:

```csharp
class CarImporter
{
    private int carsImported;

    public void ImportCars(int numberOfCars)
    {
        // Update private field
        carsImported = carsImported + numberOfCars;
    }
}
```

Note that is not customary to use public fields in C# classes. Either private fields are used or other types of members that will be discussed in subsequent exercises.

Within a class, the [`this` keyword][this] will refer to the current class. This is especially useful if a parameter has the same name as a field:

```csharp
class CarImporter
{
    private int carsImported;

    public void SetImportedCars(int carsImported)
    {
        // Update private field from public method
        this.carsImported = carsImported;
    }
}
```
