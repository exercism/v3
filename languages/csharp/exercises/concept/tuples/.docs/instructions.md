This exercise concerns utilities that analyze phone numbers.

You are asked to implement 2 features.

Phone numbers passed to the routines are guaranteed to be in the form
NNN-NNN-NNNN e.g. 212-515-9876

### 1. Analuze a phone number

Your analysis should return 3 pieces of data

1. An indication of whether the number has a New York dialing code ie. 212 as the first 3 digits
2. An indication of whether the number is fake having 555 in positions 5 to 7
3. The last 4 digits of the number.

Numbering above is 1 based.

```csharp
PhoneNumbers.Analyze("631-555-1234");
// => (false, true, "1234")
```

### 2. Detact if a phone number has a New York dialing code (212)

```csharp
PhoneNumbers.IsFake(PhoneNumbers.Analyze("631-555-1234"));
// => true
```
