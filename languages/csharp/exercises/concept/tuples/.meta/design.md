## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of the Concept of Tuples in C#.

## Learning objectives

- Know what a tuple is.
- Know how to define a tuple.
- Know how to name tuple fields.
- Know that tuples have structural equality.
- Know how to deconstruct tuples.
- Know that tuples are mutable.

## Out of scope

- The old `Tuple` class.
- Pattern matching on tuples.
- How to add tuple pattern matching to your own and built-in types.

## Concepts

This Concepts Exercise's Concepts are:

- `tuples`: know what a tuple is; know how to define a tuple; know how to name tuple fields; know that tuples have structural equality; know how to deconstruct tuples; know that tuples are mutable.

## Prequisites

This Concept Exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `basics`: know how to define methods and variables.

Any data types used in this exercise (e.g. `strings`) should also be added as prerequisites.

## Representer

This exercise does not require any specific representation logic to be added to the [representer][representer].

## Analyzer

This exercise does not require any specific analyzer logic to be added to the [analyzer][analyzer].
