# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of the Concept of enums through [C#][docs.microsoft.com-enum].

## Learning objectives

After completing this exercise, the student should:

- Know of the existence of the `enum` keyword.
- Know how to define enum members.
- Know how to assign values to enum members.
- Know how to get an enum's numeric value.
- Know how to use the `switch` statement to do constant pattern matching.

## Out of scope

- Flag enums.
- That an enum's underlying type can be changed.
- Memory and performance characteristics.
- Parse `string` into an `enum`.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `enums`: know of the existence of the `enum` keyword; know how to define enum members; know how to assign values to enum members; know how to get an enum's numeric value; know how to convert an `enum` to a `string`.
- `pattern-matching-constants`: know how to use the `switch` statement to do constant pattern matching.

## Prequisites

This exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `strings`: log lines are `string` values.
- `conditionals`: know how to execute conditional logic.
