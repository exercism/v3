# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student how the Concept of floating-point numbers is implemented in [C#][docs.microsoft.com-floating-point-numeric-types]. It will show the available floating-point types and discuss their differences.

## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the three floating point types: `double`, `float` and `decimal`.
- Know when to use which floating point type.
- Know how to write a `while` loop.

## Out of scope

- Parsing floating-point types from strings.
- Converting floating-point types to strings.
- Using standard or custom format strings.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `floating-point-numbers`: know of the existing of the three floating point types: `double`, `float` and `decimal`. know when to use which floating point type.
- `while-loops`: know how to write a `while` loop.

## Prequisites

This exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `numbers`: define numbers and apply arithmetic and boolean logic to them.
- `conditionals`: conditionally execute code based on value of floating-point numbers.

## Representer

This exercise does not require any specific representation logic to be added to the [representer][representer].

## Analyzer

This exercise does not require any specific logic to be added to the [analyzer][analyzer].
