Management are starting to apply Darwinian principles to the Remote Control Car project (TODO cross-ref-tba). The developers have been split into tow teams, red and blue and are tasked with improving the design independently. They don't need to concern themselves with design decisions of the other team.

You have been asked to take a look at the code and see how you can best combine the two efforts for testing purposes.

## 1. Find a more appropriate way of isolating the code of the two teams

Please use namespaces to better express the intention of the code.

## 2. Simplify the naming system

Whilst management are adamant that the teams should be called `RedRemoteControlCarTeam` and `BlueRemoteControlCarTeam` the names are rather cumbersome when referencing the teams. Find a way to use "Red" and "Blue" when building the cars.
