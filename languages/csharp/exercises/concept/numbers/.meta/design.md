# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student how the Concept of Numbers is implemented in [C#][docs.microsoft.com-numbers]. It will introduce this concept through the two most common numeric types in C#: `int` (whole number) and `double` (floating-point number).

## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the two most commonly used number types, `int` and `double`.
- Understand that an `int` represents whole numbers, and a `double` represents floating-point numbers.
- Know of basic operators such as multiplication, comparison and equality.
- Know how to convert from one numeric type to another; know what implicit and explicit conversions are.
- Know how to conditionally execute code using an `if` statement.

## Out of scope

- Any other numeric types besides `int` and `double` (so no `float`, `byte`, etc.).
- Parsing a `string` to an `int` or `double`.
- Converting an `int` or `double` to a `string`.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `numbers`: know of the existence of the two most commonly used number types, `int` and `double`; understand that the former represents whole numbers, and the latter floating-point numbers; know of basic operators such as multiplication, comparison and equality; know how to convert from one numeric type to another; know what implicit and explicit conversions are.
- `conditionals`: know how to conditionally execute code using an `if` statement.

## Prequisites

This exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `basics`: know how to define methods.

## Representer

This exercise does not require any specific representation logic to be added to the [representer][representer].

## Analyzer

This exercise does not require any specific logic to be added to the [analyzer][analyzer].
