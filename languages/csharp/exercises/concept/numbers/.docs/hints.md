### General

### 1. Calculate the production rate per second

- Determining the success rate can be done through a [conditional statement][tutorial-csharp.net-if-statement].
- C# allows for multiplication to be applied to two different number types (such as an `int` and a `double`). It will automatically return the "largest" data type.

### 2. Calculate the number of working items produced per second

- Whereas an `int` can be automatically converted to a `double`, the reverse does not hold. The reason for this is that an `int` has less precision than a `double` so rounding has to be applied, also the range of numbers an `int` can represent is smaller than a `double`. To force this conversion, one can either use one of the [`Convert` class' methods][docs-microsoft.com-convert] or [cast to an int][tutorial-dotnetperls.com-cast-int].
