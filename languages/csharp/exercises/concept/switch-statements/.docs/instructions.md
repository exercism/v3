You are developing a system to help the staff of a football/soccer club's web site report on matches. Data is received from a variety of sources and piped into a single stream after being cleaned up.

### 1. Output descriptions of the players based on their shirt number

The team only ever plays a 4-3-3 formation and has never agreed with the 1965 change to the rules allowing for substitutions, never mind enlarged squads.

The player descriptions are as follows:

```
1 -> "goalie"
2 -> "left back"
3 & 4 "center back"
5 -> "right back"
6, 7, & 8 -> "midfielder"
9 -> "left wing"
10 -> "striker"
11 -> "right wing"
```

Implement the static `PlayAnalyzer.OnField()` method to output a player description based on their shirt number.

```csharp
PlayAnalizer.AnalyzeOnField(10);
// => "striker"
```

### 2. Raise an alert if an unknown shirt number is encountered.

Modify the `PlayAnalyzer.OffFieldk()` method to throw an `ArgumentException` when a shirt number outside the range 1-11 is processed.

### 3. Extend the coverage to include off field activity

Implement the `PlayAnalyzer.OffField()` method to output description of activities and characters around the field of play.

You receive a stream of data that has been cleaned. Your task is to analyse it and output appropriate text to help the journalists.

The data comprises:

- shirt numbers (any integer) -> text as per on field analysis
- free form text (any string) -> the text unchanged
- incidents in play (enum Incident) -> "RedCard", "Fowl" etc.
- opposing managers (objects of type `Manager`) -> "the manager"

```csharp
PlayAnalizer.OffField(Incident.RedCard);
// => "RedCard"
PlayerAnalyzer.OffField(new Manager());
// => "the manager"
```

### 4. Where the manager has a nick name we want that output instead of "the manager"

Modify the `PlayAnalyzer.OffField()` method to output any name such as "JÃ¼rgen Klopp" if there is one. If there is no name then the `Name` property is guaranteed to be an empty string rather than null.
