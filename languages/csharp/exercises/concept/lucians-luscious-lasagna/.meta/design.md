- `type-inference`: know how to use the keyword, `var`; know when it is appropriate to use type-inference
- `return-values`: know the syntax of the return statement
- `mutation`: know how OO state is maintained and updated in C#
- `functions`: know the syntax of a function call; know the syntax of a function declaration; understand the role of functions within OO
- `comments`: know the syntax of a single line comment; know the syntax of a multi-line comment

- `variables`: know how to declare a variable; know how to use a variable

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites.

## Analyzer

This exercise could benefit from the following rules added to the the [analyzer][analyzer]:

- Verify that the `RemainingMinutesInOven()` method calls the `ExpectedMinutesInOven()` method.
- Verify that the `ElapsedTimeInMinutes()` method calls the `PreparationTimeInMinutes()` method.
