In this exercise you'll be writing code to keep track of international dialling codes via an international dialing code dictionary.

The dictionary uses an integer for its keys (the dialing code) and a string (country name) for its values.

You have nnn tasks which involve dictionaries.

### Create a New International Dialing Code Dictionary

```csharp
var dict = Dictionaries.GetEmptyDictionary();
