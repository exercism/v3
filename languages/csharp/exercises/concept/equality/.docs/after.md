`IEquatable`
`IEqualityComparer`

- mention dictionary keys
- mention structs and refer to structs exercise
- mention difficulties with floats and mention floating point after.md [here](https://github.com/exercism/v3/blob/master/languages/csharp/exercises/concept/floating-point-numbers/.docs/after.md).
- mention primitives
- equality operators mention that they are not overloaded by default and point to operators exercise.
- equality and inheritance - [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22154799/equals-method-inheritance-confusion)
- Bill Wagner's NDC 2020 talk discusses sn approach to `Equals()` with syntax that is more modern.
- insights into hash codes and a practical guide to making them
