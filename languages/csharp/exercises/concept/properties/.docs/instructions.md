In this exercise you'll be modelling a weighting machine.

You can set and get the weight in kilograms or pounds depending on which units have been selected for
the weighing machine.

Unfortunately the British author of this exercise has insisted on being able to
retrieve (although not record) the value using his county's idiosyncratic system of
weights and measures - stones, pounds and ounces

If you don't like your weight you can reduce it by applying a reduction.  In the interests
of privacy nobody should be able to retrieve that amount.  The reduction is a percentage of the weight.

Weights must never be negative.

Conversion ratios are as follows:
- 14 pounds to a stone
- 16 ounces to a pound
- 2.20462 kg to a pound
