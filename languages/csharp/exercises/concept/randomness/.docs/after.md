In C# applications randomness is generally implemented using the `System.Random` class.

This [article][system-random] is an excellent introduction to the subject.

When becoming familiar with a library class it is always worth studying the [documentation][system-random] for properties and methods and their overloads.

The coding exercise highlighted a number of issues:

- The random number generator does not require a [seed][random-seedless].
- `Random.Next()` can generate a range of integers
- `Random.Double()` can generate a double between 0 and 1
- Once you have your random number you can do what you like with it
- The upper bounds in `Next...()`, `Double()` and `Sample()` so that `Random.Next(1,19)` will yield values from 1 to 18 but not 19.

There are 3 patterns for implementing the last point:

- You can get the random number and manipulate it. In the case of the coding exercise this would consist of calling `Random.NextDouble()` and multiplying by 100. This [piece][random-use-case-array] discusses making random selections from an array.
- You can inherit from `System.Random` and override the `Sampple()` method.
- You can encapsulate an instance of `System.Random` in a class of your own, for example [to generate booleans][random-use-cases].

The numbers generated by `Random` are not guaranteed to be unique.

It is [recommended][random-thread-safety] that you instantiate `System.Random` as a static member. But, note that it is not thread safe.

You may see documentation discouraging the use of seedless constructors. This mostly applies to .NET Framework rather than .NET Core (which is what _Exercism_ uses). For the full story read [this][random-multiple-instantiations].

You are advised not to use `System.Random` for crypto or security. See this [provider][crypto-provider] and this [number generator][crypto-rng].
