We discussed in (cross-ref-tba) how the `IDispoable` interface helps signal to callers of a class that there are resources or program state that need releasing or resetting in a timely fashion when the object in question is no longer required. In this exercise we have introduced some syntactic sugar, with the `using` keyword, that makes it less noisy and less likely that significant calls will be omitted.

`using` can be seen as replacing `try/finally` for some use cases.

```csharp
var file = null;
try
{
    file = new File("myStuff.txt");
    file.Write("more stuff");
}
finally
{
    file.Dispose();
}
```

This syntax is replaced with the more compact and foolproof:

```csharp
using (var file = new File("myStuff.txt")
{
    file.Write("more stuff");
}
```

In C# 8 the following variation has been introduced where the `using` statement comes at the start of a block:

```csharp
using var file = new File("myStuff.txt";
file.Write("more stuff");
```

This allows you to have multiple disposable objects in the same block and to more naturally handle `try/catch`:

```csharp
using var fileIn = new File("myStuff.txt";
using var fileOut = new File("yourStuff.txt";
try
{
    var stuff = fileIn.Read();
    fileOut.Write(stuff);
}
catch (Exception)
{
    LogStuff();
}
```

The rules related to how the `using` keyword can be used and with instances of what sort of types are detailed [here][using-statement].

#### Note for Java Developers

Java developers may recognize this as an analog of the _automatic resource management_ mechanism introduced in Java 7. They are very similar. Java's syntax, which repurposes `try` has the advantage of incorporating `catch` blocks more naturally than does C#'s `using`.

#### Versions

Note that the more flexible version of `using` where it does not have its own syntactic block was introduced in C# 8 so be prepared for disappointment if you find that a codebase you are working on is using an earlier version of the language.
