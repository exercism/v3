Many types of struct and class members (fields being the primary exception) can use the expression-bodied member syntax. Defining a member with an expression often produces more concise and readable code than traditional blocks/statements.

Methods and read-only properties are amongst the members that can be defined with expression bodies.

```csharp
int Times3(int input) => input * 3;

int Interesting => 1729;
```

#### Ternary operators

Ternary operators allow if-conditions to be defined in expressions rather than statement blocks. This echoes functional programming approaches and can often make code more expressive and less error-prone.

```csharp
int a = 3, b = 4;
int max = a > b ? a : b;
// => 4
```

`throw` expressions are an alternative to `throw` statements and in particular can add to the power of ternary and other compound expressions.

```csharp
string trimmed = str == null ? throw new ArgumentException() : str.Trim();
```
