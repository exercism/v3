You have moved to a new competitor in the billionaire space race, As you see from the task the team is starting with the fundamentals.

Given an age in seconds, you need to calculate how old someone would be on:

- Earth: orbital period 365.25 Earth days, or 31557600 seconds
- Mercury: orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years
- Venus: orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years
- Mars: orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years
- Jupiter: orbital period 11.862615 Earth years
- Saturn: orbital period 29.447498 Earth years
- Uranus: orbital period 84.016846 Earth years
- Neptune: orbital period 164.79132 Earth years

So if you were told someone were 1,000,000,000 seconds old, you should
be able to say that they're 31.69 Earth-years old.

If you're wondering why Pluto didn't make the cut, go watch [this

In fact the task has already been coded, but the team lead feels that it could be improved by the judicious use of expression bodied members, so you have been asked to refactor the code ensuring that the existing tests will continue to pass.
