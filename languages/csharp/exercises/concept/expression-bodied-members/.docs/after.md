Many [types of struct and class members][expression-bodied-members] (fields being the primary exception) can use the expression-bodied member syntax. Defining members through expression bodies often produces more concise and readable code than traditional blocks/statements.

```csharp
int Times3(int input) => input * 3;

int Interesting => 1729;
```

Expression-bodied-members cannot have blocks of multiple statements, but those with a functional background should be warned that anything that a traditional member can do can be achieved by one of these members. The "expression" can be an assignment operation creating side effects, or a method invocation meaning that anything is possible.

#### Ternary Operators

Ternary operators allow if-conditions to be defined in expressions rather than statement blocks. This echoes functional programming approaches and can often make code more expressive and less error-prone.

```csharp
int a = 3, b = 4;
int max = a > b ? a : b;
```

#### Throw expressions

`throw` expressions are an alternative to `throw` statements and in particular can add to the power of ternary and other compound expressions.

```csharp
string trimmed = str == null ? throw new ArgumentException() : str.Trim();
```

If `str` is `null` in the above code an exception is thrown.
