Many [types of struct and class members][expression-bodied-members] (fields being the primary exception) can use the expression-bodied member syntax. Defining a member with an expression often produces more concise and readable code than traditional blocks/statements.

```csharp
int Times3(int input) => input * 3;

int Interesting => 1729;
```

Expression-bodied-members cannot have blocks of multiple statements, but those with a functional background should be warned that anything that a traditional member can do can be achieved by one of these members. The "expression" can be an assignment operation creating side effects, or a method invocation meaning that anything is possible.

#### Ternary Operators

[Ternary operators][ternary-operators] allow if-conditions to be defined in expressions rather than statement blocks. This echoes functional programming approaches and can often make code more expressive and less error-prone.

```csharp
int a = 3, b = 4;
int max = a > b ? a : b;
// => 4
```

#### Switch expression

[Switch expressions][switch-expressions] behave in a similar manner to [switch statements][switch-statements] covered in (TODO cross-ref-tba switch statements). They support a kind of decision table that maps input conditions to actions or values.

At the core of the switch expression is _pattern matching_. In the coding exercise we matched values against `const` patterns. In this case the inputs to the `switch` are a _range expression_ which is matched to const values and the inputs to the _case guards_.

```case
double xx = 42d;

string interesting = xx switch
{
    0 => "I suppose zero is interesting",
    3.14 when DateTime.Now.Day == 14 && DateTime.Now.Month == 3 => "Mmm pie!",
    3.14 => "Ï€",
    42 => "a bit of a cliche",
    1729 => "only if you are a pure mathematician"
    _ => "not interesting"
};

// => interesting == "a bit of a cliche"
```

Switch expression also support [type patterns][pattern-matching] and recursive matching.

An arm of the `switch` is selected when the pattern matches the range variable and any case guard evaluates to true.

#### Throw expressions

`throw` expressions are an alternative to `throw` statements and in particular can add to the power of ternary and other compound expressions.

```csharp
string trimmed = str == null ? throw new ArgumentException() : str.Trim();
```

If `str` is `null` in the above code an exception is thrown.
