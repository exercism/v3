- Know how to identify the presence of a pattern in a string.
- Know how to "capture" and replace text identified by patterns.

- Know that search performance can be enhanced by compiling `Regex` (discussion only)

## Out of scope

- Intermediate and advanced regular expression patterns.

## Concepts

- `regular-expressions` as they are handled in C# and .NET.

- `strings`
- `arrays`
- `for-loops`

Other prerequisites will depend on the story.
