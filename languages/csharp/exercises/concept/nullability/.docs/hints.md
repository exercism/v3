If the student gets stuck, we will allow them to click a button requesting a hint, which shows this file. This will not be a "recommended" path and we will (softly) discourage them using it unless they can't progress without it. As such, it's worth considering that the student reading it will be a little confused/overwhelmed and maybe frustrated.

The file should contain both general and task-specific "hints". These hints should be enough to unblock almost any student. They might link to the docs of the functions that need to be used.

The hints should not spell out the solution, but instead point to a resource describing the solution (e.g. linking to documentation for the function to use).
