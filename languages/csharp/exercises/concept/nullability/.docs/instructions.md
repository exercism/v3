In this exercise you'll be writing code to helping printing name
badges for factory employees.

Employees have a first and family name, and optionally a middle name. An employee's badge consists of a single line with the employee's first, middle and family name on it (in that order), with the name parts separated by a single space.

For example, if my first name is `Ernest`, my middle name is `Johnny`
and by family name is `Payne`, my badge name is: `ERNEST JOHNNY
PAYNE`.

Your task will be writing a static method called `Badge.Label`. It
will take as input parameters the first, middle and last names of the
employee. You will then compute the string to be printed on the name
line of the badge. Notice that you'll need to include spaces between
words when applicable.

Your second task will be writing a static method called
`Badge.WidthInPixels`. It will take a string and an int (a font size) as
input and it will compute the width in pixels of the print text.

For a font size of `12px`, the total width of the name of the string
`Ernest Johnny Payne` will be:

```
6*12 + 1*12 + 6*12 + 1*12 + 5*12 = 228
```

**PS**: Let us assume that the all parameters are optional, i.e. an
employee may have no first name, no middle name or no family name on
the system. Additionally, if someone forgets to configure a proper font
size, your code should react accordingly.
