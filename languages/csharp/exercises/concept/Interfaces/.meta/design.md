# Design

## Goal
The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the Concept of Interfaces in C#.

## Learning objectives

- Know what interface is.
- Know the characteristics of an interface.
- Know how interface faciliate multiple inheritance.
- Know how to implement an interface in a class.
- Know what types implement an interface.
- Know implicit and explicit interface implementations.


## Out of scope
- `Struct` type implementing an interface.
- `properties`, `events`, `indexers` member types of an interface.
- C# 8.0, an interface may define a default implementation for members.
