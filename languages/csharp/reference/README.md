## Concepts

The C# concept exercises are based on concepts. The list below contains the concepts that have been identified by the track maintainers for the C# language.

_(Please do not modify this document. it is automatically generated. All text except the concept learning objectives is sourced
                            from [exercises.json](./exercises.json) which should be updated manually when a concept is added or an issue or new design is created
                            and learning objectives are scraped from the __concept definition__ text in each exercise's design.md document)_.
