# C&#35; reference

There are three types of reference documents:

- [Concepts][concepts]
- [Keywords][keywords]
- [Types][types]

## Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute to the C# track reference documents! Contributions are very welcome!

To contribute, please go to the [concepts][concepts], [keywords][keywords] or [types][types] page and find an entry for which no reference document has yet been written and submit a PR to add the missing document.

As an alternative, you could also see if there are any [new reference issues][issues-new-reference] or [improve reference issues][issues-improve-reference].
