## Concepts

The C# concept exercises are based on concepts. The list below contains the concepts that have been identified for the C# language.

### Object-oriented

The core OO features a C# developer should know about are:

- [Encapsulation](../../../reference/concepts/encapsulation.md)
- [Classes](../../../reference/concepts/classes.md)
- [Objects](../../../reference/concepts/objects.md)
- [State](../../../reference/concepts/state.md)
- [Mutation](../../../reference/concepts/mutation.md)
- [Composition](../../../reference/concepts/composition.md)
- [Inheritance](../../../reference/concepts/inheritance.md)
- [Interfaces](../../../reference/concepts/interfaces.md)
- [Polymorphism](../../../reference/concepts/polymorphism.md)
- [Methods](../../../reference/concepts/methods.md)

### Functional

While C# is primarily an OO language, lots of functional concepts have been added to the language:

- [Immutability](../../../reference/concepts/immutability.md)
- [Pattern matching](../../../reference/concepts/pattern_matching.md)
- [Higher-order functions](../../../reference/concepts/higher_order_functions.md)
- [Type inference](../../../reference/concepts/type_inference.md)
- [Anonymous methods](../../../reference/concepts/anonymous_functions.md)
- [Recursion](../../../reference/concepts/recursion.md)
- [Local functions](../../../reference/concepts/nested_functions.md)
- [Pipelines (LINQ)](../../../reference/concepts/pipelines.md)

### Platform-specific

- [Assemblies](../../../reference/tooling/dotnet-assemblies.md)

### Memory management

- Resource passing
- [Resource allocation](./memory_allocation.md) (can include `Span<T>`/`Memory<T>` types)
- Resource cleanup
- Resource lifetime

### Methods

- Method overloading
- Named arguments
- Optional arguments
- Extension methods (mixin)

### General

- Arithmetic overflow
- [Sameness](../../../reference/concepts/sameness.md)
- [Conditionals](../../../reference/concepts/conditionals.md)
- [Enumeration](../../../reference/concepts/enumeration.md)
- Iterators (yield)
- Namespaces
- [Generics](../../../reference/concepts/generics.md)

- Boxing/unboxing
- Anonymous types
- Concurrency (can include concurrent collections)
- Asynchronous programming
- Expressions vs statements
- Attributes
- Slicing
- Unsafe code
- Reflection
- Nullability

### Types

- Signed integers
- Unsigned integers
- Floating point numbers
- [Strings][string]
- Enums
- [Characters][char]
- [Booleans][bool]
- [Arrays][array]
- [Lists][list]
- [Dictionaries][map]
- [Sets][set]
- [Queues][queue]

## Concept interpretation

The concept exercises use the following concepts:

| concept                  | interpretation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| `arrays-basic`           | Know of the existence of the `Array` type. Know how to define an array. Know how to access elements in an array by index. Know how to iterate over elements in an array. Know of some basic functions (like finding the index of an element in an array). |

This also indicates that for example `strings-basic` does **not** teach using custom formatting strings and that `numbers-basic` does **not** teach about checked/unchecked arithmetic.

## Reference docs

Reference docs are written to help explain a particular C# concept to a student when no appropriate online document can be found. They will be used when creating exercises and as references in exercise documentation.

The following reference docs have been written:

- [Code style][code_style]
- [Memory allocation][memory_allocation]

## TODO

- Reference doc on difference between `static readonly` and `const`
