## Concepts

The C# concept exercises are based on concepts. The list below contains the concepts that have been identified for the C# language.

### Object-oriented

The core OO features a C# developer should know about are:

- [Encapsulation](../../../reference/concepts/encapsulation.md)
- [Classes](../../../reference/concepts/classes.md)
- [Objects](../../../reference/concepts/objects.md)
- [State](../../../reference/concepts/state.md)
- [Mutation](../../../reference/concepts/mutation.md)
- [Composition](../../../reference/concepts/composition.md)
- [Inheritance](../../../reference/concepts/inheritance.md)
- [Interfaces](../../../reference/concepts/interfaces.md)
- [Polymorphism](../../../reference/concepts/polymorphism.md)
- [Methods](../../../reference/concepts/methods.md)

### Functional

While C# is primarily an OO language, lots of functional concepts have been added to the language:

- [Immutability](../../../reference/concepts/immutability.md)
- [Pattern matching](../../../reference/concepts/pattern_matching.md)
- [Higher-order functions](../../../reference/concepts/higher_order_functions.md)
- [Type inference](../../../reference/concepts/type_inference.md)
- [Anonymous methods](../../../reference/concepts/anonymous_functions.md)
- [Recursion](../../../reference/concepts/recursion.md)
- [Local functions](../../../reference/concepts/nested_functions.md)
- [Pipelines (LINQ)](../../../reference/concepts/pipelines.md)

### Platform-specific

- [Assemblies](../../../reference/tooling/dotnet-assemblies.md)

### Memory management

- Resource passing
- [Resource allocation](./memory_allocation.md) (can include `Span<T>`/`Memory<T>` types)
- Resource cleanup
- Resource lifetime

### Methods

- Method overloading
- Named arguments
- Optional arguments
- Extension methods (mixin)

### General

- Arithmetic overflow
- [Sameness](../../../reference/concepts/sameness.md)
- [Conditionals](../../../reference/concepts/conditionals.md)
- [Enumeration](../../../reference/concepts/enumeration.md)
- Iterators (yield)
- Namespaces

- Boxing/unboxing
- Anonymous types
- Concurrency (can include concurrent collections)
- Asynchronous programming
- Expressions vs statements
- Attributes
- Slicing

- Reflection
- Nullability

### Types

- Signed integers
- Unsigned integers
- Floating point numbers
- [Strings][string]
- Enums
- [Characters][char]
- [Booleans][bool]
- [Arrays][array]
- [Lists][list]

## Concept interpretation

The concept exercises use the following concepts:

| concept                  | interpretation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `string-formatting`      | Know how to format a string. Know where it's documented, or at least how to search for it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `bitwise-operations`     | Know how to apply bitwise operations to numbers. Know where it's documented, or at least how to search for it.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

This also indicates that for example `basic-strings` does **not** teach using custom formatting strings and that `basic-numbers` does **not** teach about checked/unchecked arithmetic.

## Reference docs

Reference docs are written to help explain a particular C# concept to a student when no appropriate online document can be found. They will be used when creating exercises and as references in exercise documentation.

The following reference docs have been written:

- [Code style][code_style]
- [Memory allocation][memory_allocation]

## TODO

- Reference doc on difference between `static readonly` and `const`
