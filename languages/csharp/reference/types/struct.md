# `Struct`

A `struct` type is a [value type][csharp-info-value_types] that is typically used to encapsulate small groups of related variables.

All simple types are structs:

- Integral types: integer numeric types and the [`char` type][csharp-type-char]
- [Floating-point types][csharp-info-floating_point_numbers]
- [`bool`][csharp-type-bool]
