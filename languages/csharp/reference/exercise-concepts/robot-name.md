[Example implementation](https://github.com/exercism/csharp/blob/master/exercises/robot-name/Example.cs)

## General

- functions: used as the main entry point to this exercise
- constructors: initalizing values when object is created
- conditionals using if: conditionally execute logic using an `if` statement
- classes: the tested method is defined in a class
- objects: creating an object to keep track of the robot
- state: keeping track of the names
- members: methods linked to a class instance
- static variables: keeping state across class instances
- hashSet: test suite uses hash set to ensure name is unique
- random numbers: using the built in `Random` class
- visibility: making tested method and tested class `public`
- imports: import types through `using` statements
- namespaces: knowing where to find the `HashSet` class
- do while loop: loop to find valid names
- regex: test suite uses regex to test valid names
