### Reference documents

A list of reference documents for the various [concepts][reference-concepts], [types][reference-types], and [keywords][reference-keywords] found in C#. [Learn more about how you can help improve the reference documents][reference].

### Test runner

The test runner automatically verifies if a submission passes all the tests. [Learn more about how you can help with the test runner][docs-test-runner].

### Representer

The representer creates a general representation of a submission, in order to automatically give feedback on similar code. [Learn more about how you can help with the representer][docs-representer].
