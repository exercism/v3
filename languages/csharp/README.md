# C&#35;

Welcome to the workspace for Exercism v3's C# track!

The Exercism v3 C# track helps students learn C#. It does this through a series of carefully designed Concept Exercises and Practice Exercises. This repository contains all those exercises, as well as reference documentation that help explain C# concepts for which no appropriate online document could be found.

## Contributing

The C# maintainers have written out specs for lots of exercises that need writing. You can help us by choosing an exercise and implementing it. You can find the list of exercises [here][github-issues-new-exercise] - each one has detailed instructions on what to do.
