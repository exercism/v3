## Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute to the C# track!

There are several areas we need help with to get C# ready for V3:

- [Implement a concept exercise][docs-concept-exercises]
- [Write reference documentation][docs-reference]
- [Work on the representer][docs-representer]
- [Work on the analyzer][docs-analyzer]
- [Work on the test runner][docs-test-runner]

[docs-concept-exercises]: ./docs/concept-exercises.md
[docs-reference]: ./docs/reference.md
[docs-analyzer]: ./docs/analyzer.md
[docs-representer]: ./docs/representer.md
[docs-test-runner]: ./docs/test-runner.md

## Reference

We have put together a [reference guide](./docs/reference.md) to C# to help us understand what concepts we need to teach. Contributions are very Welcome!
