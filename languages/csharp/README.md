# C&#35;

Welcome to the workspace for Exercism v3's C# track!

The Exercism v3 C# track helps students learn C#. It does this through a series of carefully designed Concept Exercises and Practice Exercises. This repository contains all those exercises, as well as reference documentation that help explain C# concepts for which no appropriate online document could be found.

## Contributing

The C# maintainers have written out specs for lots of exercises that need writing. The biggest way you can help would be to choose an exercise and implement it. You can find the list of exercises [here][github-issues-new-exercise] - each one has detailed instructions on what to do.

If you'd like to work on something else, contributing to reference docs would also be helpful. You can find out how to help with reference docs [here][reference].
