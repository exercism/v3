This issue describes how to implement the `booleans` concept exercise for the Java track.

## Getting started

**Please please please read the docs before starting.** Posting PRs without reading these docs will be a lot more frustrating for you during the review cycle, and exhaust Exercism's maintainers' time. So, before diving into the implementation, please read up on the following documents:


- [The features of v3](https://github.com/exercism/v3/blob/master/docs/concept-exercises.md).
- [Rationale for v3](https://github.com/exercism/v3/blob/master/docs/rationale-for-v3.md).
- [What are concept exercise and how they are structured?](https://github.com/exercism/v3/blob/master/docs/features-of-v3.md)

Please also watch the following video:

- [The Anatomy of a Concept Exercise][anatomy-of-a-concept-exercise].
