## General

- [List documentation] [list-doc] : documentation for the interface for `List<T>`.
- [ArrayList documentation] [arraylist-doc] : documentation for `ArrayList<T>`.
- [List Tutorial] [list-tutorial] : quick tutorial about Lists with examples.

## 1. Create a new list
- As `List<T>` is an interface, don't forget that you can't instantiate it directly.
Use the `ArrayList<T>` (or another implementation of `List<T>`).

## 2. Define an existing list
- You can begin with an existing list then add elements. See this [article] [list-add] on adding an item.

## 3. Add a new language to a list
- See this [article] [list-add] on adding an item.

## 4. Count the languages in the list
- See this [article][list-count] on retrieving the number of items in a list.

## 5. Check the last added language
- See this [article][list-get] on retrieving an item with its index.
- Don't forget that the index begins at 0. What is the index of the last item?

## 6. Check to see if a language is in the list
- See this [article][list-contains] on checking if an item is in a list.

## 7. Remove Language
- See this [article][list-remove] on removing an item from the list.

## 8. Check if a language is unique
- As a list is a collection, the `foreach` exists to iterate over it.
- See this [article][string-equals] to check if a String is equal to another.

## 9. Find where a language is in your list
- See this [article][list-indexof] on retrieving the position of an item in a list.
