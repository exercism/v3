# Futher Reading

* A large resource of reference and training material can be found at the [PowerShell GitHub repostory](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/learning-powershell/powershell-beginners-guide.md#recommended-training-and-reading])
* PowerShell Documentation is found at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/
* Channel 9 series on [Getting Started with PowerShell 3.0](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/GetStartedPowerShell3).  This is still a valuable series even though PowerShell 3.0 is now old and superseded.
