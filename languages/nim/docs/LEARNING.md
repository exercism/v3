Exercism provides exercises and feedback but can be difficult to jump into for those learning Nim for the first time. These resources can help you get started:

[Nim in Action](https://book.picheta.me/) is a great book, I would say that this is one of the best resources for learning Nim and what you can do with the language. I highly recommend this book as a good starting point.

The [Standard Library Documentation](https://nim-lang.org/docs/lib.html) is a great resource for looking at items that are part of the Nim's standard library and how to use them.

[Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/nim/) is good for getting a quick overview of the syntax of Nim and is good for a reference guide.

[Dominik Picheta's Nim Playlist on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm-fq5xBdPkrMuVkPWuho7XzszB6kJ2My) is a list of videos going over Nim and solving some problems using Nim.

Also, the Nim community is extremely helpful and willing to help answer newcomer's questions, the [Nim Community Page](https://nim-lang.org/community.html) list all the places to chat with people in the Nim community.
