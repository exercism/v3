ColdFusion (CFML) is a JVM scripting language whose syntax is similar to C or JavaScript. 
It JIT compiles to byte code that runs on the JVM but is dynamic and loosely typed, making it fast and easy to develop in. 
CF is a multi-paradigmed language, supporting classical OO and functional programming.

CFML also has a built-in tag-based templating language that makes it ideal for web apps. 
It runs in a J2EE container with many bundled libraries that make it very productive without the need to install many packages. 
CFML has native support for zip files, PDF and Excel generation, E-mails, FTP, HTTP, S3 file systems, ESAPI security libraries, JDBC drivers, JSON and REST APIs.  

CFML can also leverage any Java project by dropping the jars in project and directly instantiating Java objects in your code.
