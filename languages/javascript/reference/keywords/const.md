# `const`

The `const` keyword is used to create a read-only reference to a value.
```javascript
const NAME = "Bob";
```
The value it holds is still [mutable](../info/immutability.md), but the variable identifier cannot be reassigned:
```javascript
const NAME = "Bob";

NAME = "Steve";
// TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
```
or redeclared:
```javascript
const NAME = "Bob"

const NAME = "Sally"
// SyntaxError: Identifier 'NAME' has already been declared
```
Variables declared using the `const` keyword are [block-scoped](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope), meaning they are only accessible within the current block, and any contained sub-blocks.

The value that a variable declared using `const` holds can only be referenced *after* it has been defined. This is known as the [Temporal Dead Zone](https://wesbos.com/temporal-dead-zone/).
