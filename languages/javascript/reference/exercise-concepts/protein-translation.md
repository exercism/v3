# Concepts of protein translations

[Example implementation](https://github.com/exercism/javascript/blob/master/exercises/protein-translation/example.js)

## General concepts

- Constants
- Using Objects as Maps or
- Using a `Map` and accessing it via `Map#get`
- Accessing Objects using bracket notation
- Creating functions
- breaking out of a loop
- throwing Errors
- Pushing into an array

## Depending on implementation could also be:

## When using a for loop to parse and translate rna in one go

- Using for-loops
- Using for-loops with custom step size
- Using `String#substring` to access parts of

## When first splitting then translating rna

- Using `String.match(/.{1,3}/g)` to get codons
- Using `Array#reduce` to create the response
