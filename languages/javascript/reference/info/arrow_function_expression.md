# Arrow Function Expression

An arrow function expression is a syntactically compact alternative to a regular function expression, although without its own bindings to the `this`, `arguments`, `super`, or `new.target` keywords. Arrow function expressions are ill suited as methods, and they cannot be used as constructors.
