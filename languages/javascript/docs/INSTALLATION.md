This track relies on [NodeJS][web-nodejs] throughout to provide a runtime for
JavaScript. This means that we assume all execution of JavaScript on your
computer will happen using [NodeJS][web-nodejs].

# Track Requirements

Many machines come pre-installed with [NodeJS][web-nodejs], or might have been
installed previously, or as a dependency. So before we do anything, we should
check if it's already installed:

1. Open up a _terminal_ (`Terminal`, `cmd`, `Powershell`, `bash`, ...)
1. `node -v`

If [NodeJS][web-nodejs] is installed, a version is displayed. Write this version
down. If [NodeJS][web-nodejs] is _not_ installed, an error will be written out.
Usually something along the lines of `'node' is not recognised`.

## NodeJS

### If node is pre-installed

Browse to [the NodeJS website][web-nodejs]. It will display _two_ versions (if
it detects your OS. Otherwise select your OS first). If your `node -v` version
matches one of these, you're good. If it doesn't, we recommend that you use
Node LTS. If you're worried upgrading might break something on your system, you
can continue as if everything is fine; we won't be able to provide support when
something unexpected happens.

### If node is not installed

There are a couple of ways to install [NodeJS][web-nodejs]:

- via an [Installer or Binary][web-nodejs-download]
- via a [package manager][web-nodejs-package]

Both options support Windows, MacOS, and Linux. If you don't know what to do,
using an installer is the easier.

- We recommend using the **LTS** version. This is also indicated as _recommended_
  on the [NodeJS][web-nodejs] website "for most users".
- Follow the instructions on the webpage and/or during the installer and install
  [NodeJS][web-nodejs].

### Testing the installation

After the installer is done, or the package manager has completed, or the binary
has been copied and the instructions have been followed, it's good to test if
everything is alright.

1. Open up a _terminal_ (`Terminal`, `cmd`, `Powershell`, `bash`, ...)
1. `node -v`

The version should match the one on the website.

**Note**: It is important you open a _new_ terminal window. Any open terminal
windows might not have been refreshed after the installation completed. This
means that the open terminals don't know that a new program was installed.

> `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc`:

> On Windows open the start menu and search for "environment variables". You'll

> Usually these are found at `C:\Program Files\nodejs`. If you browse here with
> your `File Explorer`, you should find `node.exe`, `npm.bat` and `npx.bat`.
>
> Close any open terminals and open a new one.

### Assignment Requirements

Please follow [these instructions][cli-walkthrough] to download exercism cli for your OS.

Once CLI is all setup & configured, download the first exercise - `hello-world`:

```bash
$ exercism download --exercise=hello-world --track=javascript
```

Each assignment then needs some tools to run the tests. They can be installed
running this command within each assignment directory:

```bash
$ npm install
```

> **But what is npm and why does this work?**
>
> You don't need this information in order to complete the JavaScript track, but
> if you're eager to understand what just happened, the following paragraphs are
> for you:
>
> This works because `npm` is a package manager that comes bundled with
> `NodeJS`, which has been installed per the steps above. The `npm` command
> looks for a `package.json` file, which is present in _each_ assignment folder.
> This file lists the `"dependencies"` above, which are then downloaded by `npm`
> and placed into the `node_modules` folder.
>
> The scripts in the `package.json` use the binaries from the local
> `node_modules` folder, and it's these scripts that are used to run the tests,
> as listed in the `exercise` description.
