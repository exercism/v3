# `undefined`

[JavaScript][language-javascript] differentiates between the _absence of value_ ([`null`][type-null]) and the _absence of assignment_.

A [variable][concept-variables] that has not been assigned a value is of type `undefined`. A [method][concept-functions] or statement also returns `undefined` if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns `undefined` if a value was not returned.
