# JavaScript

Welcome to the workspace for Exercism v3's JavaScript track!

This area will contain everything needed to launch the JavaScript track, including:

- The new exercises and `config.json` file.
- Reference documentation that help explain JavaScript concepts for which no appropriate online document could be found.
- JavaScript-specific documentation for contributors.
