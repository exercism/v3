In this exercise you'll be writing code to understand the concepts of type conversion that you might encounter in your everyday code

Given two arrays made up of digits, write a function that turns the digits into numbers and then sums the numbers.

## Tasks

## 1. Find the sum of two arrays

Implement a function to calculate the sum of two array element given the array of two numbers:

```javascript
twoSum([1, 2, 3], [0, 0, 7])
//=> 130
```

The result should be a number and the array element only contains as integer

After the calculator the owner would like to know the sum that he got is a lucky number or not.

A number is said to be lucky if the the reverse of the number is the same

## 2.  Determine if the number is lucky

Implement a function to determine whether the number is lucky for him or not.

```javascript
luckyNumber(1441)
//=>  true
luckyNumber(123)
//=> false
```

He decide to send the result of this number to his partner to make it easy for him to read

## 3. Dashify the number

Implement a function that added the dash after each number and convert it in the form of string

```javascript
dashify(1466)
//=> "1-4-6-6"
```
