In this exercise, you'll be implementing the game logic for the game of `pokemon mania` that your team of friend is developing.The game of pokemon will have trainers 1-1 battle with their pokemon.You are the incharge of developing this particular logic.You have to help the team to make the fight and add some new features to it

After sometimes your teams decides that each pokemon will have the different kind of stats in the form of the object with different values.These are task assigned to you.The values of can be null or a number or string.Special attacks will be in the form of string

## Tasks

const pokemon2 = { name: 'charmander', hp: 22, absorb: null }
checkPokemonData(pokemon1, pokemon2) //=>{hp:22,absorb:null}
```

Implement a function named `validCommonDetails` that takes an object from the above the result and return the object with valid value.

```javascript
const pokemonDetails = { hp: 22, absorb: null }
validCommonDetails(pokemonDetails) //=>{hp:22}
```

### 3- You need to check if the number exist in the value of details in order to show the message of draw and not another move is possible from the result you obtained above

Implement a function named `findSecretNumber` that takes a Number and the above result as an object.The function return `true` if the number exists in the stats otherwise return `false`:

```javascript
const commonDetails = { hp: 22 }
findSecretNumber(22, commonDetails) //=>true
