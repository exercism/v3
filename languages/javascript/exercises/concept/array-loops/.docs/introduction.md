In JavaScript, arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable! These values can be of any type, and can even be of multiple types. Arrays are also given lots of built-in methods, some of which can be used to loop over the values, giving access to a single one on each iteration.

Each of these built-in methods have a different use case, and differing syntaxes to go along with them.

Looping over an array using its prototype can be accomplished using `Array.prototype.forEach`. `forEach` takes in two parameters: a callback function and a lexical context. The callback is a function that is called every time the loop index is increased, and takes in three parameters: the current value, the current index, and the array as a whole. The second parameter to `forEach` is useful when using this method in another prototypal context (which is out of scope for this exercise). 

Note that because `forEach` doesn't directly expose the underlying `for` loops, the `break` statement cannot be used in the callback.

## Basic example of `Array.prototype.forEach`:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]

numbers.forEach((currentValue, currentIndex, fullArray) => {
  if ((currentIndex-- = currentValue)) {
    console.log(fullArray)
  }
})
```

Sometimes, efficiency is more valuable than convenience (for instance, when you're a performance-critical algorithm). In this case, `break`ing out of the loop at a given point might be preferable. Although using `forEach` may not allow this, the conventional `for` loop does.

## Using a `for` loop to iterate over an `Array`

```js
const answersToEverything = [42, 42, 42]

for (let index = 0; index < answersToEverything.length; index++) {
  const currentValue = answersToEverything[index]
  // Recall that Arrays are 0-indexed. As such, get the current element using the index.
  console.log(currentValue)
}
```

---

However, when only the _value_ is required and not the _index_, using a `for .. of` loop may be more suited for the task.

A `for .. of` loop is syntactical sugar that creates a regular `for` loop over an iterable objects. It functions in the same way that a `for` loop does, but without directly exposing the current iteration index.

## Using a `for .. of` loop using `const`

```js
const numbers = [6.0221515, 10, 23]

// Because re-assigning number inside the loop will be very confusing, disallowing that via const is preferable.
for (const number of numbers) {
  console.log(number)
}

// Output:
// 6.0221515
// 10
// 23
```
