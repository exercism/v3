## 1. Determine how many cards of a certain type are in the deck
Try using `forEach` and an integer variable to loop over the array, increasing the variable each round to increase the count.

## 2. Determine if there are any unique cards
You can store the counts of each type of card in an object or array, through looping over the deck. At the end, you can compare those counts; any card that only has one occurrence will be unique!

## 3. Determine how many odd or even cards there are
Try using the modulo `%` operator to compare the parity of each card in the stack.
