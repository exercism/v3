## 1. Double every single card

- There is a [built-in][map_method_docs] method great for simple transforms like this.

## 2. Create multiple copies of every 3 found in the deck

- There is a [built-in][reduce_method_docs] method perfect for custom transforms or accumulations (like summing an array, etc.)

## 3. Find two cards from the exact middle of the deck

- There is a [built-in][slice_method_docs] method for slicing and dicing arrays into smaller segments.

## 4. The outside two cards will reappear in the middle of the deck

- There is a [built-in][splice_method_docs] method for inserting or removing items from the middle of an array.
- Array also has built-ins for removing the first and last elements. [MDN Array documentation][array_docs]

## 5. Every card that isn't 2 disappears

- There is a [built-in][filter_method_docs] method for filtering or excluding items in an array.

## 6. Convert a shuffled deck into a perfectly ordered deck

- There is a [built-in][sort_method_docs] method for sorting.

## 7. Change every card to the total number of cards

- There is a [built-in][fill_method_docs] method for filling an array with a single value.
