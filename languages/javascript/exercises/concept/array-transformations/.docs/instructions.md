Elyse, magician-to-be, continues her training. She will be given a deck of cards and attempt to transform that deck. She will make certain cards appear, disappear, change their values, or completely rearrange themselves.
To make things easier, she usually only starts with cards numbered 1 to 10, although some of the tricks may result in larger cards being created.

## 1. - Double every single card

Elyse wants to double the number of every card in the deck. This may result in higher cards than 1-10.

```javascript
const deck = [1, 2, 3, 4, 10]
seeingDouble(deck)
// => [2, 4, 6, 8, 20]
```

## 2. - Create multiple copies of every 3 found in the deck

Elyse wants to triplicate ever 3 found in the deck. If a deck started with a single 3, after the trick the deck would have three 3's in place of original.

```javascript
const deck = [1, 3, 9, 3, 7]
threeOfEachThree(deck)
// => [1, 3, 3, 3, 9, 3, 3, 3, 7]
```

## 3. - Find two cards from the exact middle of the deck

Elyse will take a deck and make every card disappear except the middle two cards. This trick is always performed with exactly 10 cards.

```javascript
const deck = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
middleTwo(deck)
// => [5, 6]
```

## 4. - The outside two cards will reappear in the middle of the deck

Elyse wants to move the top and bottom cards of the deck into the middle, in reverse order.

```javascript
const deck = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10]
sandwichTrick(deck)
// => [2, 3, 10, 1, 5, 6]
```

## 5. - Every card that isn't 2 disappears

Elyse's favorite number today is 2. In this trick every card that isn't a 2 will disappear from the eck.

```javascript
const deck = [1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 2]
twoIsSpecial(deck)
// => [2, 2]
```

## 6. - Convert a shuffled deck into a perfectly ordered deck

Elyse wishes to demonstrate her mastery of reordering the cards perfectly - no matter how well shuffled.

```javascript
const deck = [10, 1, 5, 3, 2, 8, 7]
perfectlyOrdered(deck)
// => [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10]
```

## 7. Change every card to the total number of cards

Elyse will transform the whole deck into only cards that match the deck size.
Hand her 7 random cards and you'll get back 7 sevens.

```javascript
const deck = [10, 1, 5, 3, 2, 8, 7] // 7 cards
countingCards(deck)
// => [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]
```
