## 1. Monitor the humidity level of the room

- You might want to use an [if...else condition][if-else-condition] to check if the humidity percentage is higher than the maximum allowed value.

## 2. Detect overheating

- This function should be very similar to the `checkHumidityLevel`. You might want to check [how to construct a new object][class-constructor] from a class

## 3. Monitor the machine

- Make sure that you handle all the errors in the catch block, you should have 4 different cases.
