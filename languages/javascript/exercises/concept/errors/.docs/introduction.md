Errors are useful to report when something is wrong or unexpected in a program or a piece of code.

They are javascript objects.

The main property of this object is `message`:

```javascript
const error = new Error('Oops, something went wrong')

console.log(error.message)
// => "Oops, something went wrong"
```

Using the `throw` syntax, you can throw an Error.

```javascript
throw new Error('Oops')
```

When an Error is thrown, the current execution is stopped and resume in the first catch block of the call stack.

```javascript
try {
  throw new Error('Oops')
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error.message)
  // => "Oops"
}
```

As any object in Javascript the Error can be "extended" to create Custom errors. You can use the `instanceof` syntax to check if the error catched is an instance of a particular object.

```javascript
class CustomError extends Error {}

try {
  // ... Code that may throw an error
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof CustomError) {
    console.log('The error thrown is an instance of the CustomError')
  }
}
```
