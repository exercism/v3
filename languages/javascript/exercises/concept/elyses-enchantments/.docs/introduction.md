In Javascript, an array is a list-like structure with no fixed length which can hold any type of primitives or ojects, even mixed types. The array elements can be accesed by their index.

Example of an array declaration and accessing an element by index:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 'two', 3, 'four']
numbers[2]
// => 3
```
