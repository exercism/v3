## callbacks

Callbacks are functions which are passed as arguments to another function. This is often done to control the order of execution in an asynchronous context. Writing a callback function is no different from writing a function, but the callback function's arguments must match the signature required by the calling function.

```javascript
const squareLength = 5

// Caller function takes a callback function
function applyToSquare(callback) {
  return callback(squareLength)
}

// Callback must expect the possible argument from the calling function
function areaOfSquare(number) {
  return number * number
}

applyToSquare(areaOfSquare) // => 25
```

You may also write callbacks as a function expression:

```javascript
applyToSquare(function squarePerimeter(side) {
  return side * 4
})
```
