### 1. Check card position

- Array indices starts at `0`.
- There is a [built-in][indexof_method_docs] method to get given value index.

### 2. Check whether the given card is in the stack

- There is a [built-in][includes_method_docs] method to check whether the value is present in the array

### 3. Check whether every card in stack is even number
