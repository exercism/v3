### 1. Check card position

- Array `index` start from `0`.
- There is a [built-in][indexof_method_docs] method to get given value index.

### 2. Check whether the given card is in the stack

- There is a [built-in][includes_method_docs] method to check whether the value was included in the array

### 3. Check whether every card in stack is even number

- There is a [built-in][every_method_docs] method to check if every value
  in the array pass the test implemented by `function` we pass into parameter

### 4. Check whether stack contains odd number

- There is a [built-in][some_method_docs] method to check if the array contain at least one value
  that pass the test implemented by `function` we pass into parameter

### 5. Retrive the first odd value card from the stack

- There is a [built-in][find_method_docs] method to get the first value in array that pass the test implemented by `function` we pass into parameter

### 6. Check the position of the first even card from stack

- There is a [built-in][findindex_method_docs] method to get the first index in array that the value
  pass the test implemented by `function` we pass into parameter
