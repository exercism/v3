Elyse, magician-to-be, continues her training. She will be given several stacks of cards that she needs to perform her tricks.
To make things a bit easier, she only uses the cards 1 to 10.

In this exercise, use built-in methods to analyse the contents of an array.

### 1. Find the position of a card

Elyse wants to know the position (index) of a card in the stack

```javascript
const card = 2
getCardPosition([9, 7, 3, 2], card)
// => 3
```

### 2. Determine if a card is present

Elyse wants to determine if a card is present in the stack -- in other words, if the stack contains a specific `number`.

```javascript
const card = 3
doesStackIncludeCard([2, 3, 4, 5], card)
// => true
```

### 3. Determine if each card is even

Elyse wants to know if every card is even -- in other words, if each number in the stack is an even `number`.

```javascript
isEachCardEven([2, 4, 6, 7])
// => false
```

### 4. Check if the stack contains an odd-value card

Elyse wants to know if there is an odd number in the stack

```javascript
doesStackIncludeOddCard([3, 2, 6, 4, 8])
// => true
```

### 5. Get the first odd card from the stack

Elyse wants to know the value of the first card that is odd

```javascript
getFirstOddCard([4, 2, 8, 7, 9])
// => 7
```

### 6. Determine the position of the first card that is even

Elyse wants to know the position of the first card that is even

```javascript
getFirstEvenCardPosition([5, 2, 3, 1])
// => 1
```
