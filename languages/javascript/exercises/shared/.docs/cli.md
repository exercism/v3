# CLI

## Setup

Go through the setup [instructions for JavaScript][docs-exercism-javascript] to install the necessary dependencies.

## Requirements

Install assignment dependencies:

```shell
# Using yarn
yarn

# Alternatively using npm
npm install
```

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```shell
# Using yarn
yarn test

# Alternatively using npm
npm test
```

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped. This is to encourage you to solve the exercise one step at a time.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by changing `xtest` to `test`.

## Submitting the solution

Once none of the tests are skipped and they are all passing, you can submit your solution using `exercism submit numbers.js`.

## Writing custom tests

If you wish to write additional, custom, tests, create a new file `custom.spec.js`, and submit it with your solution together with the new file:

```shell
exercism submit number.js custom.spec.js
```
