# Learning JavaScript with an ActionScript background

> This is a stub

ActionScript is no longer developed (last release June 27, 2006), so the importance of this transition, which is already unlikely, declines with time. That said, people might have known JavaScript and its EcmaScript 3 standard, learned actionscript and now need to transition to know EcmaScript 6 and beyond.
