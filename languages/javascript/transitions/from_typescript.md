# Learning JavaScript with a TypeScript background

> This is a stub

This transition is very unlikely, as many if not all will learn JavaScript before learning TypeScript. That said, as TypeScript is mostly a superset of JavaScript, JavaScript proficiency can be acquired by:

- Dropping type annotations
- Dropping tooling such as `tsc` (TypeScript Compiler)

And focusing on JavaScript-only features, which are either discouraged in TypeScript or not even supported, such as:

- Prototype-based inheritance using `Object.create`
