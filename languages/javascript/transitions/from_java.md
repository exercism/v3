# Learning JavaScript with a Java background

## Same

Syntax similarity

## Diff

> JavaScript can function as both a procedural and an object oriented language. Objects are created programmatically in JavaScript, by attaching methods and properties to otherwise empty objects at run time, as opposed to the syntactic class definitions common in compiled languages like C++ and Java. Once an object has been constructed it can be used as a blueprint (or prototype) for creating similar objects.

- Compile-time vs run-time
- Generics vs dynamic typing
