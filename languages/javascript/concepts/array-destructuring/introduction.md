Javascript's array destructuring syntax is a concise way to extract values from an array and assign them to distinct variables.

In this example, each value in the `numberOfMoons` array is assigned to its corresponding planet:

```javascript
const numberOfMoons = [0, 2, 14]
const [venus, mars, neptune] = numberOfMoons

neptune
// => 14
```
