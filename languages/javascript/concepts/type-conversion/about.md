JavaScript values can be of many types, when performing operations or comparisons, types need to either be _explicitly converted_ to the same type, or _implicitly coerced_ to the same type.

Generally, type coercion is avoided because it is averse to unexpected errors. Instead, opt for practices which allow for explicit type conversion.

An overview of these terms can be found on _MDN Web Docs_:
