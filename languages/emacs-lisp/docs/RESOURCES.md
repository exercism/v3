## Getting Help

1. [The Emacs Wiki](http://emacswiki.org/) is invaluable. Spend lots of time here.
2. [The Emacs Editor](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html) is the official manual for GNU Emacs.
3. IRC - there are [freenode](https://freenode.net/) channels for `#emacs`, `#prelude`, and many Emacs
   packages, and many helpful folks around. And with emacs, IRC is as close as
   `M-x erc`.
4. [Exercism Support](https://gitter.im/exercism/support) Gitter chat is also a good place to get help from the
   exercism community.
