So you've installed Emacs. Now what?

Well, you can start the tutoral by pressing `C-h t`, and that's not a bad place
to start. If you're completely new to Emacs, the [Emacs Prelude](http://batsov.com/prelude/) package offers a
nice set of sensible defaults and packages.

The best documentation on Emacs Lisp is... shipped with Emacs itself!
to access the
[Emacs Lisp Reference](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/elisp.html),
type `C-h i` and find the Elisp entry, or select Help &rarr; More Manuals
&rarr; Emacs Lisp Reference.  Note that the manual may be missing in some
distributions, in which case you can find
it [online](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/elisp.html).

If you are brand new to Elisp, you can read the
[Introduction to Emacs Lisp](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsLispIntro),
which is opened the same way.
