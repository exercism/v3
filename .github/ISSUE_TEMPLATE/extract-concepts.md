Extract the list of concepts required to solve the v2 <LANG> exercise: `<SLUG>`. For each concept, describe why it is required to solve the exercise. Keep in mind that an exercise can have multiple approaches (you can find community solutions here: `https://exercism.io/tracks/<LANG>/exercises/<SLUG>/solutions`). The goal of this task is to help determine the total list of concepts that make up `<SLUG>`.

The list of concepts should be stored in the following document: `languages/<LANG>/reference/exercise-concepts/<SLUG>.md`. [Use this link to create a PR to add this document][pr-link].
