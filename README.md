# Exercism - v3

Welcome to Exercism v3!

This repository is the work-in-progress space as we migrate from v2. After launch, it will become a permanent home for information about languages on Exercism, and a space for maintainers to discuss changes that need to occur across tracks.

**If you know which language you want to contribute to and just want to get stuck in, then start with its README, which you can find [in this list](languages/README.md).**
