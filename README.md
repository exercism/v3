# Exercism - V3

## An Introduction

Welcome to Exercism V3!

This repository is the work-in-progress space as we migrate from v2. After launch, it will become a permanent home for information about languages on Exercism, and a space for maintainers to discuss changes that need to occur across tracks.

This repository is large and complex, containing lots of information and content. We have put various docs together to get you started.

If you know which language you want to contribute to, and just want to get stuck in, then we recommend viewing [that language's README](../languages/README.md).
