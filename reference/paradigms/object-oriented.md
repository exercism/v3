# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

TODO: add description of object oriented programming

These are object oriented programming concepts that are found in the majority of OO languages. For each, this document will list a canonical reference that explains the concept in general terms. The tracks should link to these references the first time the topic is referenced. For example, the first time a person is expected to deal with classes, the README should say "if you are unfamiliar with the concept of classes, please read this explanation...."

Track-specific sub-concepts of these could be covered by specific track exercises. Each section below aims to draw the distinction between general and language-specific concepts.

## Concepts
