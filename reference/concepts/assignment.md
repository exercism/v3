# Assignment

## The Concept

An assignment statement sets and/or re-sets the value stored in the storage location(s) denoted by a variable name; in other words, it copies a value into the [variable][concept-variables]. In most imperative programming languages, the assignment statement (or expression) is a fundamental construct.

## What to cover

- **How to assign values** How to assign a value to a variable.
- **How to update a value** How to update a variable's value.

## Exercises

### Lasagna cooking

This exercise deals with cooking a lasagna dish in the oven. The reference implementation (C#) teaches:

- How to assign a value to a variable.
- How to update a variable's value.
