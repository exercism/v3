# Conditionals

This covers the general concept of `if`/`else`.

Tracks should teach non-standard ways that conditionals are used in their languages (e.g. the ternary operator, postfix `if` in Ruby, `unless` in Ruby, `x if y else z` in Python).

## Exercises

### LogLevel

This exercise takes log message codes and return a symbol (atom) to characterize it. The reference implementation (Elixir) teaches:

- conditional blocks using the `cond/1` function
