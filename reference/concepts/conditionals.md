# Conditionals

This covers the general concept of `if`/`else`.

Tracks should teach non-standard ways that conditionals are used in their languages (e.g. the ternary operator, postfix `if` in Ruby, `unless` in Ruby, `x if y else z` in Python).

## Exercises

### LogLevel

This exercise takes a code derived from a log message and returns a unique symbol to characterize it.
