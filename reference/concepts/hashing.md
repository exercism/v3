# Hashing

> A hash function is any [function][concept-functions] that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. The values returned by a hash function are called _hash values_, _hash codes_, _digests_, or simply _hashes_. The values are used to index a fixed-size table called a [_hash table_][type-hash-map]. Use of a hash function to index a hash table is called _hashing_ or _scatter storage addressing_.
