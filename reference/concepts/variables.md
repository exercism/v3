# Variables

This is the concept of assigning a name to a piece of data.

Some languages use static types whereas others allow dynamic types.
Some languages only have constants, whereas others allow for mutability.
A student might not be familiar with these different variations, but should be familiar in general with the assigning and using of variables.
