# Bitwise manipulation

While manipulating individual [bits](../types/bit.md) may not be a concept that a lot of programmers will be familiar with, this is a general programming topic, which we don't aim to teach. It might be important in a language, in which case an early exercise to demonstrate the syntax would be valid, but for many languages, it could be "discovered" through a later side exercise. In either situation, a link should be provided to the canonical article.
