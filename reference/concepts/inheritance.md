# Inheritance

## The Concept

Defining [classes][concept-classes] as a hierarchy, with a specific class (Dog) inheriting the behavior and data of its more generic parent (Animal).

## What to cover

- **What is inheritance?** Why use inheritance?
- **How to use inheritance.** What is the syntax to inherit from a class? How to override methods, etc.
- **Are there limitations to inheritance?** Is there multi-inheritance or only single-inheritance?

## Exercises

### Role-playing game

This exercise models a role-playing game with wizards and warriors that can attack each other. The reference implementation (C#) teaches:

- Defining an abstract class.
- Defining classes that inherit from an abstract class.
- Overriding abstract methods.
- Overriding virtual methods.
- Calling the base class' constructor from a derived class.
- Restrict access to inheriting classes using access modifiers.
