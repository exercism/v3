# Actor Model

The _actor model_ is a computational model of concurrency where an _actor_ is the computational primitive. In response to messages sent by other _actors_, the _actor_ can: make local decisions, create more actors, send more messages, determine how to respond to the next message. They can manage their own private state, and can affect other _actors_ only by sending a message.<sup>1</sup>
