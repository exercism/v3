# Boolean logic

We expect students to know [booleans](../types/boolean.md) (`TRUE` and `FALSE`) as a concept, and be familiar with logical `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`.

Track specific exercises could cover precedence or unusual rules around boolean logic, but should not try to teach it from scratch.

## Exercises

### Pac-man game logic

This exercise looks at various game events and determine if they have occured by looking at various game states. The reference implementation (Elixir) teaches:

- Boolean values
- Boolean operators
- Boolean operator precedence

#### Implementations

| Track  | Exercise                          | Changes |
| ------ | --------------------------------- | ------- |
| Elixir | [booleans][implementation-elixir] | None    |

### RPG game logic

This exercise determines whether specific characters are awake (true or false) and checks whether a certain plan will work or not dependent on which characters are sleeping. The reference implementation (JavaScript) teaches:

- Boolean values
- Boolean operators
- Boolean operator precedence

#### Implementations

| Track      | Exercise                              | Changes |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- | ------- |
| C#         | [booleans][implementation-csharp]     | None    |
| F#         | [booleans][implementation-fsharp]     | None    |
| JavaScript | [booleans][implementation-javascript] | None    |
| PureScript | [booleans][implementation-purescript] | None    |
