# Boolean logic

We expect students to know [booleans](../types/boolean.md) (`TRUE` and `FALSE`) as a concept, and be familiar with logical `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`.

Track specific exercises could cover precedence or unusual rules around boolean logic, but should not try to teach it from scratch.

## Exercises

### Pac-man game logic

This exercise looks at various game events and determine if they have occured by looking at various game states. The implementation in Elixir teaches:

- boolean values
- boolean operators
- boolean operators precedence
