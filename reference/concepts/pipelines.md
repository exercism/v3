## Pipelines

Functional languages usually don't rely (or sometimes don't even support) imperative iteration constructs like for-loops to iterate over data.
Instead, most functional languages have a rich set of functions that provide iteration functionality, like `map`, `filter` and `reduce`.

Working with data usually means combining several of these functions, where the output of one function is the input of another functions. This setup is sometimes referred to as a "pipeline."
