# Comments

## The Concept

A comment is a way to annotate code in order to explain its meaning.

## What to cover

- **What comments are supported?** Are single- and or multiline comments supported?
- **How to define a comment?** What syntax is used to define a comment?
- **Are comments required to have a specific format?** Some languages have special rules for commenting, in order to add semantic meaning to the comments. If so, explain what these rules are.
