# Switch

> In computer programming languages, a switch statement is a type of selection control mechanism used to allow the value of a variable or expression to change the control flow of program execution via search and map.
>
> Switch statements function somewhat similarly to the if statement used in programming languages […] and exists in most high-level imperative programming languages[…] using such keywords as switch, case, select or inspect.
>
> Switch statements come in two main variants: a structured switch, as in Pascal, which takes exactly one branch, and an unstructured switch, as in C, which functions as a type of goto. The main reasons for using a switch include improving clarity, by reducing otherwise repetitive coding, and (if the heuristics permit) also offering the potential for faster execution through easier compiler optimization in many cases.<sup>1</sup>
