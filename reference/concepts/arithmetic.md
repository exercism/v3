# Arithmetic

Students should understand the concepts of arithmetic and its normal syntax (`+`, `-`, `*`, etc). Languages that have unusual syntax or prefer methods to symbols should have an exercise demonstrating this.

## Arbitrary precision arithmetic

> _Arbitrary-precision arithmetic_, also called _bignum arithmetic_, _multiple-precision arithmetic_, or sometimes _infinite-precision arithmetic_, indicates that calculations are performed on numbers whose digits of precision are limited only by the available memory of the host system.
