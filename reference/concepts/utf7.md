# UTF-7

> UTF-7 (7-bit Unicode Transformation Format) is a variable-length [character encoding][concept-encoding] that was proposed for representing [Unicode][concept-unicode] text using a stream of [ASCII][concept-ascii] characters. It was originally intended to provide a means of encoding Unicode text for use in Internet E-mail messages that was more efficient than the combination of [UTF-8][concept-utf8] with quoted-printable.
