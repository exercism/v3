# Return value(s)

Many programming languages allow for _returning a result_ from a [function][concept-functions] or subroutine. Often this happens using a **return statement**.

A return statement causes execution to leave the current subroutine and resume at the point in the code immediately after the instruction which called the subroutine, known as its return address, i.e. it resumes execution where the function was originally called. The return address is saved by the calling routine, today usually on the process's call stack or in a register. Return statements in many languages allow a function to specify a return value to be passed back to the code that called the function.
