## Recursion

## The Concept

The ability to define a function that calls itself, see [recursion][concepts-recursion]

## What to cover

- **What is recursion?** Wwhat is recursion? When should it be used?
- **What forms or recursion are supported?**: Are recursive functions supported? Recursive types? Does the language supports tail recursion?
- **Using recursion**: How can recursive functions/types be defined?

## Exercises

### Ordering pizzas

This exercise handles ordering pizzas. The reference implementation (F#) teaches:

- Know what recursion is.
- Know how to define a recursive function.
- Know how to define a recursive type.
- Know how to write a tail-recursive function.
- Know how to recursively process lists.
