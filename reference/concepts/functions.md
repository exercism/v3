# Functions

## The Concept

By "functions" we mean functions, methods and procedures.

We do not aim to teach:

- "functions" as the concept of self-contained pieces of functionality
- the concepts of passing data into functions
- the concept of returning data from functions

Language-specific rules such as closures, anonymous functions, or partial application, should be covered in tracks.

## What to cover

- **How to define a function** How to define a function. How to add functionality to a function?
- **How to use function parameters** How to define function parameters and how to use them.
- **How to return a value from a function** How to return a value from a function. Does it require a specific keyword?
- **How to invoke a function** How to invoke a function and pass arguments to it.
