# undefined

> An undefined variable in the source code of a computer program is a variable that is accessed in the code but has not been previously declared by that code.
>
> In some programming languages, an implicit declaration is provided the first time such a variable is encountered at compile time.
> In other languages such a usage is considered to be sufficiently serious that a diagnostic being issued and the compilation fails.
>
> Some language definitions initially used the implicit declaration behavior and as they matured provided an option to disable it (e.g. Perl's "use warnings" or Visual Basic's "Option Explicit").<sup>1</sup>
