# Concepts

This section aims to outline all concepts that are taught within Exercism, providing a canonical description / resource that can be provided by tracks. Within exercise READMEs, tracks should link to the generic description and then go on to outline details of their own language-specific implementations.

For example, we might have one or many exercises on "enumeration" in Ruby. The exercise README would start by taking the generic description of looping and enumeration from here and then add its own language-specific information. It might read something like this:

> Most languages have a concept of looping or enumerating through a data-structure. Depending on your background, you might be familiar with "for loops" or maybe using a method `.each`. In you are unfamiliar with the concepts around looping or enumeration, or would like a reminder, check out `[this article](...)`.
>
> In Ruby we generally use enumeration using....

We should not presume a programmer knows these topics, and should ensure that tracks explain them clearly both in the general term and how they are used in a language.

For example the concept of `null` (or `nil` or `None`) does not exist in some languages, and is extremely esoteric the first time it is encountered. We should therefore ensure that we explain its purpose in the language, and provide good documentation for learning more, as well as providing an exercise that demonstrates its language-implementation.
