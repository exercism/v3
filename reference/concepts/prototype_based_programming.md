# Prototype-based programing

> Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which behaviour reuse (known as inheritance) is performed via a process of reusing existing objects via delegation that serve as prototypes.
> This model can also be known as prototypal, prototype-oriented, classless, or instance-based programming.
> Delegation is the language feature that supports prototype-based programming.
>
> Prototype-based programming uses generalized objects, which can then be cloned and extended.
> Using fruit as an example, a "fruit" object would represent the properties and functionality of fruit in general.
> A "banana" object would be cloned from the "fruit" object and general properties specific to bananas would be appended.
> Each individual "banana" object would be cloned from the generic "banana" object.
> Compare to the class-based paradigm, where a "fruit" class would be extended by a "banana" class.<sup>1</sup>
