# Closures

## The Concept

A `closure` is the use of one or more variables in an inner lexical scope from an outer lexical scope. Historically, this nomenclature was derived from [_Î»-calculus_][wiki-lambda-calculus] and popularized by [_scheme_][wiki-scheme] ([source][wiki-closure]) to reference a function's open and closed variable bindings.

## What to cover

- **What a closure is.** What makes up a closure in your language?
- **How to define a clojure.** Does it occur transparently (like JavaScript)? Is it explicit (like PHP)? What syntax?
- **How to use a clojure.** What can you use it for? Dynamic functions, function composition, memoizing, callbacks?
