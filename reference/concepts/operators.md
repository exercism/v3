# Operators

Operators are constructs which behave generally like [functions][concept-functions], but which differ syntactically or semantically from usual functions. Common simple examples include [arithmetic][concept-arithmetic] (addition with `+`), [comparison][concept-comparisons] (with `>`), and [logical operations][concept-conditionals] (such as `AND` or `&&`). More involved examples include [assignment][concept-assignment] (usually `=` or `:=`), field access in a record or object (usually `.`), and the scope resolution operator (often `::`). Languages usually define a set of built-in operators, and in some cases allow users to add new meanings to existing operators or even define completely new operators.
