# Appointment scheduler

## Story

In this exercise you'll be working on an appointment scheduler for a beauty salon in New York that opened on September 15th in 2012.

You have four tasks, which will all involve appointment dates. The dates and times will use one of the following three formats:

- `"7/25/2019 13:45:00"`
- `"July 25, 2019 13:45:00"`
- `"Thursday, July 25, 2019 13:45:00:00"`

The exercise will ensure that the code is executed under the `en-US` culture.

## Tasks

These are example tasks that fit the appointment scheduler exercise:

- Parse appointment date
- Check if an appointment has already passed
- Check if appointment is in the afternoon
- Describe the time and date of the appointment
- Return the anniversary date
