# RNA & DNA Processing

## Story

In biology libraries, Nucleic Acids may be encoded as 4-bit types (see for example [BioSymbols.jl](https://github.com/BioJulia/BioSymbols.jl/blob/master/src/nucleicacid.jl)).
This can be used as a context for an exercise introducing primitive types, or other concepts related to bit manipulation.

The v2 exercises `hamming`, `rna-transcription` and `nucleotide-count` could be reused but with primitive types instead of [`strings`][types-string]/[`chars`][types-char].
You could consider adding those exercises twice (perhaps as practice exercise) in the progression path, once with [`strings`][types-string]/[`chars`][types-char] and then later on with primitive types.
