# Shopping cart exercise

There are multiple ways of solving this exercise. It's probably necessary to master some basic concepts like: strings, hashes or collections before this exercise can be tackle.
It's probably a good candidate to introduce the concept of state.

## Instructions

Your task is to define a shopping cart for a corner shop. The cart should keep track of the list of items added, and correctly calculate the price.

Items are added to the basket using stock-keeping unit (SKU) codes. The items in the shop are:

| Name      | Price | SKU    |
| --------- | ----- | ------ |
| Potatoes  | 10.00 | STAPOT |
| Rice      | 30.00 | STARIC |
| Coffee    | 14.99 | STACOF |
| Newspaper | 2.99  | MEDNEW |

You need to define a `ShoppingCart` class, with three public methods:

- `add`: Takes a SKU and adds it to the cart. The SKU is a `Symbol` comprised of the first three uppercase letters of the product type + the first three uppercase letters of the product name.
- `total_amount`: The value of the items in the cart as a number with two decimal places (e.g. 3.99).
- `items_list`: A list of the names of the items in the cart, ordered alphabetically, with no duplicates, separated by a comma and a space.

For example:

```ruby
shopping_cart = ShoppingCart.new
shopping_cart.add(:STAPOT)
shopping_cart.add(:STARIC)

shopping_cart.total_amount
// Returns: 40.00

shopping_cart.items_list
// Returns: "Potatoes, Rice"
```
