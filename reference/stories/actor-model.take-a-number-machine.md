# Take-A-Number Machine

## Story

You are writing an embedded system for a Take-A-Number machine. It is a very simple model. It can give out consecutive numbers and report what was the last number given out.

## Tasks

- Make the machine report its state (last given out number).
- Make the machine give out a number.
- Make the machine stop when asked to.
- Ensure the machine can handle unexpected messages.
