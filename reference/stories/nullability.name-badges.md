# Name badges

## Story

In this exercise you'll be writing code to print name badges for factory employees. Employees have an ID, name and department name. Employee badge labels are formatted as follows: `"[id] - [name] - [DEPARTMENT]"`.

Due to a quirk in the computer system, new employees occasionally don't yet have an ID when they start working at the factory. As badges are required, they will receive a temporary badge without the ID prefix.

Even the factory's owner has to wear a badge at all times. However, an owner does not have a department. In this case, the label should print `"OWNER"` instead of the department name.

## Tasks

These are example tasks that fit the employee badges exercise:

- Print a badge for an employee
- Print a badge for a new employee
- Print a badge for the owner
