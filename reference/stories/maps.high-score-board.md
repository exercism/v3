# High Score Board

This exercise uses the setting of maintaining a high-score board for an arcade hall to teach the concept of key-value [collections][collection] ([maps][map], [hashes][hash], associative arrays, [dictionaries][dict], etc.). A player's name serves as the key, and the score serves as the value.

The student is then guided through some operations:

- Creating a new empty collection.
- Adding a player to the collection.
- Putting values associated with existing players in the collection.
- Updating the values in the collection.
- Returning an ordered-by-key list from the collection.
- Returning an ordered-by-value list from the collection.
