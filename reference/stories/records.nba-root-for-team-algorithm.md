In this exercise you're a big sports fan and you've just discovered a passion for NBA basketball. Being new to NBA basketball, you're doing a deep dive into NBA history, keeping track of teams, coaches, their win/loss stats and comparing them against each other.

As you don't yet have a favorite team, you'll also be developing an algorithm to figure out whether to root for a particular team.

These are example tasks that fit the NBA root-for-team algorithm exercise:

- Define records for an NBA team, its coach and its stats
- Create a team's coach
- Create a team's stats
- Create a team
