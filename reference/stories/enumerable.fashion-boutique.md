# Fashion Boutique

## Story

You are running an online fashion boutique. Black Friday is coming up, so you need to take stock of your inventory to make sure you're ready.

A single item in the inventory is represented by a map/dictionary, and the whole inventory is a list/array of such maps/dictionaries.

```elixir
%{
  name: "White Shirt",
  price: 40,
  quantity_by_size: %{s: 3, m: 7, l: 8, xl: 4}
}
```
