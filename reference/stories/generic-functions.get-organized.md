# Get Organized

## Story

You are an internationally renowned organizing guru; your books and lectures have helped people around the world to organize and declutter their lives. To do this you have developed a number of tools to help organize all sorts of things. You have a tool to organize `Int`s a tool to organize `String`s a tool to organize `Double`s and on and on. There's only one problemâ€¦ you have so many tools, you can't keep them organized.

What you need to do in order to declutter your life is write a single tool that can organize _any_ type of thing. You have two tasks to help you do just that.
