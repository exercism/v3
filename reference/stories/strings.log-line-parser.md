# Log line parser

## Story

In this exercise you'll be processing log-lines.

Each log line is a string formatted as follows: `"[<LEVEL>]: <MESSAGE>"`.

There are three different log levels:

- `INFO`
- `WARNING`
- `ERROR`

## Tasks

These are example tasks that fit the log line parser:

- Get message from a log line
- Get log level from a log line
- Convert a log line to a different format
