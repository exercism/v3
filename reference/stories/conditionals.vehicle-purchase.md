# Vehicle Purchase

## Story

In this exercise you're going to write some code to help you help you prepare to buy a new vehicle.

You have three tasks, one to help you determine the price of the vehicle you can afford, one to determine what kind of license you will need to get, and one to help you compute your yearly registration fees.

## Tasks

These are examples of tasks that fit the story of purchasing a vehicle:

- Compute whether or not you can afford the monthly payments on a given vehicle given a monthly budget and a 0% loan
- Determine the type of drivers license you will need based on the class of vehicle
- Calculate the registration fees for your new vehicle
- Calculate insurance rates based on your age and the vehicle's value
