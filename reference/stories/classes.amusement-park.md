# Amustment Park Attendee

## Story

In this story, you are working with an amusement park to implement an admittance system. People (attendee) come in to the park and are measured for their height on arrival. This is because certain rides in the park require you to be a certain height to ride for safety purposes.

Some attendees choose to purchase a ride pass, so it is then issued to the attendee. The actual representation of the pass is unimportant for the Ruby exercise -- so it is represented by an Integer if it exists, `nil` otherwise.

Part 1 (instance-variables exercise) deals with instance variables, getters and setters

Part 2 (booleans) deals with boolean values, truthiness, comparison methods and logical operators

## Tasks

Example tasks:

- Admit a new person (Attendee) to the park
- get the ride pass, height
- issue a pass
- revoke a pass
- check if the person has a pass
- check if a person fits a ride
- check if a person is allowed to ride
