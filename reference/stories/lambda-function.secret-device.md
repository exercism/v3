# Secret Device

This story uses the setting of creating a device to encrypt messages reliably and repeatedly using [anonymous functions][anon-fns].

Concepts explored:

- [Anonymous functions][anon-fns]
- [Function composition][fn-composition]
- [Higher order functions][higher-order]

The story also adapts well for [bitwise-manipulation][bitwise-manipulation] and the [bit][bit] type.

and composing functions.
