# Lasagna Recipe

The story of this exercise uses a lasagna recipe to focus on the creation of basic [functions][fns], [operators][ops], [integers][ints], and [return values][returns].

It facilitates defining functions:

- Returning the expected cooking time.
- Calculating the remaining time in the oven.
- Calculating preparation time as a function of the number of lyers in a lasagna.
- Calculating the total cooking time.
