# High school sweethearts

## Story

In this exercise, you are going to help high school sweethearts profess their love on social media by generating an ASCII heart with their initials:

```
     ******       ******
   **      **   **      **
 **         ** **         **
**            *            **
**                         **
**     J. K.  +  M. B.     **
 **                       **
   **                   **
     **               **
       **           **
         **       **
           **   **
             ***
              *
```
