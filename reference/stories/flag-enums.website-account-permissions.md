# Website account permissions

## Story

In this exercise you'll be checking permissions of user accounts on an internet forum. The forum supports three different permissions:

- Read
- Write
- Delete

There are three types of accounts, each with different default permissions:

- Guests: can read posts.
- Users: can read and write posts.
- Moderators: can read, write and delete posts.

Sometimes individual permissions are modified, for example giving a guest account the permission to also write posts.

## Tasks

These are example tasks that fit the website permissions exercise:

- Get default permissions for an account type
- Grant a permission
- Revoke a permission
- Check for a permission
