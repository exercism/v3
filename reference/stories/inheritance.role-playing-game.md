# Role-playing game

## Story

In this exercise you're playing a role-playing game named "Wizard and Warriors," which allows you to play as either a Wizard or a Warrior.

There are different rules for Warriors and Wizards to determine how much damage points they deal.

For a Warrior, these are the rules:

- Deal 6 points of damage if the attacked character is not vulnerable
- Deal 10 points of damage if the attacked character is vulnerable

For a Wizard, these are the rules:

- Deal 3 points of damage if the Wizard did not prepare a spell in advance
- Deal 12 points of damage if the Wizard did prepare a spell in advanced

In general, characters are never vulnerable. However, Wizard _are_ vulnerable if they haven't prepared a spell.

## Tasks

The story facilitates defining functions:

- Describe a character
- Make characters not vulnerable by default
- Allow Wizards to prepare a spell
- Make Wizards vulnerable when not having prepared a spell
- Calculate the damage points for a Wizard
- Calculate the damage points for a Warrior
