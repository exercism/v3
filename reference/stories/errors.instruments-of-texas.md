# Instruments of Texas

## Story

In this exercise you will be handling errors being raised by functions created by your team while creating an RPN calculator.

(Note: there is no actual implementation of a calculator in this exercise.)

## Tasks

The student implements a function in to handle errors in three ways:

- allow the error to propagate
- rescue (catch in some languages) from the error, output a result that communicates the failure (e.g. `:error` in Elixir)
- rescue (catch in some languages) from the error, output a result that communicates the failure with a message (e.g. `{:error, "message"}` in Elixir)

## Implementations

- [Elixir: errors][implementation-elixir] (reference implementation)
