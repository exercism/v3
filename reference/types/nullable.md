# Nullable

A nullable type is a type where values can either be present or absent ([null](null.md)).

### Nullability

This exercise prints employee information on a badge and wraps the
text to fit on a given maximum width. The reference implementation
(Csharp) teaches:

- the `null` literal
- basic `null` checking at compile time and runtime
- nullable types
