# Tuple

A data structure that groups together a fixed number of items. Unlike an [array][type-array], the tuple can usually contain items of more than one type. Often used to implement records.

## Exercises

### Kitchen Calculator

This exercise asks student to create and maintain few functions which use tuples as grouped information to represent different kitchen measurements

- Tuples
- Tuples as grouped information
- Getting values from a tuple by use of element index

### Santa's Helper

This exercise asks the student to the student to implement a pair of functions which extract values from tuples, create tuples, and work with named tuple fields.

- Tuples
- Extract tuple components
- Decompose tuples via pattern matching
- Create and extract components of labeled and unlabeled tuples
