# Map

> In computer science, an associative array, map, symbol table, or dictionary is an abstract data type composed of a collection of (key, value) [pairs][type-pair], such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection.

There are various implementations of this abstract data structure, such as, but not limited to:

- [Hash map][type-hash-map]
