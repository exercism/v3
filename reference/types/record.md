# Record

## The Concept

A record is a collection of fields (which can be of different types) that belong together. It is a type of [product type](product_type.md).

## What to cover

- **Syntax**: how to define a record.
- **When to use records**: are there alternatives over using records? When is using a record the preferred way?
- **Mutability**: are records mutable or immutable? If immutable, how to return a modified version of the record?
