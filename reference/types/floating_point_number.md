# Floating-point number

A floating point number is a real number, which differ from whole numbers in that a real number also allows for exponent digits.

Programming languages may name their floating point type to the amount of _precision_ they can hold, whereas the following is based on [the IEEE 754 standard][wiki-ieee754]:

- [Half][type-half] (occupying 16 [bits][type-bit])
- [Single][type-single] (occupying 32 [bits][type-bit])
- [Double][type-double] (occupying 64 [bits][type-bit])
- Quadruple (occupying 128 [bits][type-bit])
- Octuple (occupying 256 [bits][type-bit])
