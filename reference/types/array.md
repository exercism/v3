# Array

## The Concept

A [collection][type-collection] data structure often consisting of a of elements of the same type, each identified by an array index. The simplest type of array is a linear (one-dimensional) array.

## What to cover

Tell a student what an array is in your language, how an array can be manipulated, and ensure they understand where to look for docs on arrays.

- **Explain what arrays are in your language?** Are the arrays fixed sized or not? Can an array contain elements of different types?
- **How to access an array element?** What is the syntax for accessing an array element? Where do indexes start from in your language?
- **How to create an array?** What is the syntax for creating a new array?
- **How to add or remove elements from an array?** What is the syntax for various manipulations of an array?

## Exercises

### Stack of cards

This exercise deals with manipulatating a stack of playing cards. The reference implementation (Javascript) teaches:

- Create an array
- Accessing an element from an array
- Changing an element from an array
- Deleting an element from an array
- Adding an element to an array
- Using the length of an array
