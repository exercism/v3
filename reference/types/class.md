# Class

## The Concept

A class is a core concept of object-oriented programming. It provides a template for creating instances of this class. Besides data, classes also have behavior ([methods][concept-functions]) associated with them.

A class is a type of [product type][type-product-type].

## What to cover

- **What is a class?** Why use classes?
- **How to define classes.** What is the syntax to define a class?
- **How to create instances of a class.** The syntax to create a new instance of a class.
- **Access members of a class.** How to use fields/methods on a class instance.

## Exercises

### Remote Control Car

This exercise models a remote control car that keeps track of the distance it has driven and its battery charge percentage. The reference implementation (C#) teaches:

- Defining a class.
- Creating an instance of a class.
- Defining a field on a class.
- Update a field on a class.
- Restrict access to fields using access modifiers
