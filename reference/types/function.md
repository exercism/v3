# Function

## The Concept

In some languages, [functions][concept-functions] have their own type. This may or may not be a [generic][concept-generics].

## What to cover

- **How to define a function** How to define a function. How to add functionality to a function. How does scoping the function work?
- **How to use function parameters** How to define function parameters and how to use them.
- **How to return a value from a function** How to return a value from a function. Does it require a specific keyword?
- **How to call a function** How to call a function and pass arguments to it.

## Exercises
