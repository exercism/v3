# Pointer

A pointer is a construct that stores the memory address of another value located in computer memory. A pointer _references_ a location in memory, and obtaining the value stored at that location is known as dereferencing the pointer.

## Null pointer

A null pointer or _null reference_ has a value reserved for indicating that the pointer or reference does not refer to a valid object. Programs routinely use null pointers to represent conditions such as the end of a list of unknown length or the failure to perform some action; this use of null pointers can be compared to nullable types and to the Nothing value in an option type.
