# Object

In many programming languages, `object` is a generic data type. It either exists high-up, possibly at the top of, the _[class][concept-classes] hierarchy_, and/or is the non-primitive base type.

## Other uses

> An object can be a [variable][concept-variables], a data structure, a [function][concept-functions], or a [method][concept-functions], and as such, is a value in memory referenced by an identifier.
>
> In the [class-based][concept-classes] object-oriented programming paradigm, `object` refers to a particular [instance of a class][concept-objects], where the object can be a [combination][type-product-type] of variables, functions, and data structures.
>
> In relational database management, an object can be a table or column, or an association between data and a database entity (such as relating a person's age to a specific person).
