# Long

Long is short for `long int`.

> A long integer\_ can represent a whole integer whose range is greater than or equal to that of a standard integer on the same machine. In C, it is denoted by `long`. It is required to be at least 32 [bits][type-bit], and may or may not be larger than a standard integer, but this is **not** required.

See [`integer`][type-integer].
