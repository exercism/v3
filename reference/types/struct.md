# Struct

Structs are types that allow for combining your code into logical units. In some languages, structs may just collections of heterogeneous data, similar to [records][type-record]. And in other languages structs may be more like [classes][type-class], allowing for the grouping of data and behavior in the form of [functions or methods][concept-functions] and may act as templates for the creation of instances of the struct.

## What to cover

- **What is a struct?** Why use structs?
- **How to define structs.** What is the syntax to define a struct?
- **How to create instances of a struct.** The syntax to create a new instance of a struct.
- **Access members of a struct.** How to use fields/methods on a struct instance or type.

## Exercises

### Windowing System

This exercise models the implementation of a simplified windowing system for an operating system:. The reference implementation (Swift) teaches:

- Define a Size struct
- Define a Position struct
- Define a Window class
- Add a method to resize windows
- Add a method to move windows
- Add methods to update the window text and display window information
- Create a new Window
