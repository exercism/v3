# Integer

## The Concept

An integer is a whole number (no fractions). There are two basic types of integers

- Unsigned integers: only positive integers (0, 1, 2, ...).
- Signed integers: positive _and_ negative integers (..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2).

### Sizes

Various programming languages _limit_ the range of values a single integer can hold. They may also have various variants that have different range restrictions. Theses names include, but are not limited to:

- [Bit][type-bit]
- [Byte][type-byte]
- [Char][type-char]
- [Short][type-short]
- [Long][type-long]
- [Word][type-word]

## What to cover

A student may have no understanding of floating point numbers as more than numbers with decimal points.

- Explain what integer types are supported in your langauge, and when to use them.
- Ensure that type conversions are understood if appropriate (e.g. rounding, overflows)
- Ensure that students know how to compare numbers to each other.

## Exercises

### Production Line Analysis

This exercise asks students to write code to analyse the production of an assembly line. The reference implementation (C#) teaches:

- Arithmetic
- Comparing numbers
- Converting between integers and floating point numbers.
- Conditionals
