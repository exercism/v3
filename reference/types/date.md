# Date

A date is a type that represents a date. Some date types might included _timezone information_, whilst others are without. Some date types include [time][type-time] information, whilst others refer to a time range (the entire day) or an arbitrary moment during that day (such as midnight, or mid-day).

The difference between two dates may be representable by a [Duration][type-duration] or DateInterval.

See also [DateTime][type-datetime] and [Time][type-time].
